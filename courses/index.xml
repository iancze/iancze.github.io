&lt;p>Interferometric astrophysical observations are a vast and deep topic. The goal of this course is to help students develop a &lt;strong>practical understanding&lt;/strong> of how interferometers (in particular arrays like the VLA or ALMA) &lt;strong>observe an astrophysical source&lt;/strong>, build a &lt;strong>mathematical foundation&lt;/strong> for working with &lt;strong>complex-valued, Fourier-plane data&lt;/strong>, and survey some of the many approaches that are used to &lt;strong>investigate astrophysical phenomena&lt;/strong>, focusing on &lt;strong>forward-modeling&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>regularized maximum likelihood&lt;/strong> techniques.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>If you are in any way feeling ill or suspect you might have been contact with an individual infected with COVID, &lt;em>please&lt;/em> stay home and seek medical care if necessary.&lt;/strong> We plan on posting all lecture notes, and we will work with you to provide you with the course materials you need.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="course-calendar-and-closure-policies">Course Calendar and Closure Policies&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>ASTRO 589 meets &lt;strong>once a week on Wednesdays from 10:10am to 11:00am ET (prompt) in Davey Lab Room 538&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For full information on lecture dates and topics, see the &lt;a href="https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro589/schedule/">Course Schedule&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If campus should be closed (e.g. for a weather-related event or COVID precautions), the instructor will provide instructions via email on course lecture format (possibly remote, keeping the same schedule) and examinations/assignments (due dates to be rescheduled &lt;em>no earlier than 48 hours&lt;/em> after closure announcement).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="assignments-and-project">Assignments and Project&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="course-grade">Course Grade&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The course grade will be based on&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>problem sets (55%)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>group project and presentation (45%)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="problem-sets">Problem sets&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Problem sets will be assigned approximately every 2-3 weeks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please turn in homeworks in &lt;code>.PDF&lt;/code> format to Ian by email at &lt;a href="mailto:ipc5094@psu.edu">ipc5094@psu.edu&lt;/a> with the subject line &lt;code>ASTRO 589 problem set&lt;/code>. Handwritten solutions are fine, but please digitize your submission using a department scanner or a smartphone scanner app (e.g., &lt;a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat/mobile/scanner-app.html">Adobe Scan&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Due dates will be set to correspond to the beginning of a class period (i.e., 10:10am).&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="programming">Programming&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>For problem sets, students are encouraged to use whatever programming language they are most comfortable with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some project choices, especially those involving CASA, may require basic familiarity with the Python programming language.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="problem-set-late-policy">Problem set late policy&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>The following percentages will be deducted from your score&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>one day late: 5%&lt;/li>
&lt;li>two days late: 10%&lt;/li>
&lt;li>three days late: 25%&lt;/li>
&lt;li>more than 72 hours late: no credit&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If extenuating circumstances arise such that you will be unable to complete the homework on time, please contact Ian &lt;em>before&lt;/em> the homework deadline and we can most likely arrange an extension.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="problem-set-collaboration-policy">Problem set collaboration policy&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>You are encouraged to collaborate and work through the problem sets together. However, each student must complete the final write up on their own, i.e., no problem set should be duplicated verbatim between students.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="group-project-and-presentation">Group project and presentation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Students will form groups of 2-3 for their course projects. Groups will propose a project concept around some aspect of interferometry and discuss in detail at least one major astrophysical application. The project idea may be based of the list of example projects (below) or may be an original idea proposed by the group.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project will culminate in a presentation to the class. This presentation will be a comprehensive lecture on your topic, which should take 35 minutes of our class period, followed by 15 minutes of detailed questions and answers. Students may submit any additional materials beyond their presentation for review, if so desired; however, no final report is required.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good presentations will:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Provide a cogent astrophysical and technical introduction&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Connect to course material covered (if applicable)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Introduce the key supporting background material, including any relevant equations or seminal figures from related works&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Copious citations to and explanations of relevant literature&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Explain the key observational or theoretical instruments/methodologies (as applicable)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Identify at least one major astrophysical application and discuss in detail&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Contain some new aspect of technical development or investigation by the group&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finish the presentation within the allotted time (35 +/- 5 minutes)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adequately answer questions raised by the instructor and students&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Each group should provide the instructor with the two dates that they prefer by &lt;strong>Wednesday, September 21st&lt;/strong>. The instructor will then assign one presentation date to each group. You should notify the instructor of your project topic at least two weeks prior to your presentation date to confirm that it is an acceptable choice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is a wise idea to practice your presentation from start to finish &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo; to make sure your timing is correct. Groups whose talks are wildly under/over time will find it difficult to achieve full credit.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="example-project-ideas">Example Project Ideas&lt;/h4>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Cross-validation strategies for imaging (including for RML)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How do MRI imagers work, and what are their fundamental relationships to radio interferometers?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Optical interferometers and science results&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Download a dataset from the ALMA archive, image with CLEAN or RML techniques&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Calibration techniques for ALMA and EHT&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Self-calibration theory and application with CASA&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Spectral line capabilities of ALMA, image a molecular line from ALMA archive&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wavelets: what are they, how have they been used in radio astronomy applications&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Design new ALMA observations using CASA/simobserve&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Expanding MPoL to do model fitting with Pyro&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Expanding MPoL to use nufft for gridding&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="masking-policy">Masking Policy&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We encourage you to get COVID-19 vaccinated and follow University policies on masking, especially in indoor spaces. In consultation with background rates in Centre County, masks may be required part or all of the fall semester (see policy below).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>University policy&lt;/em>: Penn State University requires everyone to wear a face mask in all university buildings, including classrooms, regardless of vaccination status. ALL STUDENTS MUST wear a mask appropriately (i.e., covering both your mouth and nose) while you are indoors on campus. This is to protect your health and safety as well as the health and safety of your classmates, instructor, and the university community. Anyone attending class without a mask will be asked to put one on or leave. Instructors may end class if anyone present refuses to appropriately wear a mask for the duration of class. Students who refuse to wear masks appropriately may face disciplinary action for Code of Conduct violations. If you feel you cannot wear a mask during class, please speak with your adviser immediately about your options for altering your schedule.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’ dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="objectives">Objectives&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The interstellar medium (ISM) is the space between the stars. This space is far from empty, however, and consists of large reservoirs of atomic and molecular gas and solids in the form of &amp;ldquo;dust&amp;rdquo; that mediate or contribute to many important astrophysical processes such as star formation, planet formation, stellar feedback, and stellar death/supernovae. Considered in aggregate, these processes are important on galactic- (and even intergalactic-) scales, influencing the distribution of giant molecular clouds and stellar populations. As such, Astro 542 is at once a course about &lt;em>nothing&lt;/em> and a course about &lt;em>everything&lt;/em>. We will learn the astrophysical processes that govern the interactions between the ISM and its many astrophysical interfaces. Students will also learn telescope proposal writing strategies, prepare a mock ALMA proposal, and simulate the dual-anonymous distributed peer review process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="format">Format&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>ASTRO 542 meets three times a week on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday on Zoom in a &lt;em>remote synchronous&lt;/em> format from 9:05am to 9:55am ET (prompt). &lt;strong>If you are in any way feeling ill or suspect you might have been contact with an individual infected with COVID, &lt;em>please&lt;/em> stay home and seek medical care.&lt;/strong> We plan on recording and posting all lectures, and we will work with you to provide you with the course materials you need.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="masking-policy">Masking Policy&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Though this course is remote synchronous, we encourage you to get vaccinated and follow University policies on masking, especially in indoor spaces.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="paper-presentation">Paper presentation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Each student will give one 15 minute presentation with 5 minutes of questions (equivalent to journal club talk) on an article from the last 1-2 years. Please select an article submitted to the Astrophysical Journal, Astronomical Journal, MNRAS, or A&amp;amp;A that has &lt;em>completed the referee process&lt;/em> (i.e., is available from the journal itself, or is labeled &amp;ldquo;accepted&amp;rdquo; on the arXiv). Chosen articles should fall under the subjects that have been covered by the intervening topics since the previous student talk. To select a paper, you can search for papers in &lt;a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#">ADS&lt;/a> based in terms (or combinations of them) appearing in titles or abstracts (e.g., extinction, molecular cloud).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each student should provide the instructor with the two dates that they prefer by Monday, August 30th. The instructor will then assign one date to each student. You should notify the instructor of your paper selection at least one week prior to your presentation date to confirm that it is an acceptable choice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good talks will&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Provide a cogent introduction to the subfield of the paper&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Introduce the key supporting background material, including any relevant equations or seminal figures from related works&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Explain the key observational or theoretical instruments/methodologies (as applicable)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discuss the scientific findings of the paper, and their implications for the broader astrophysical subfield&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Finish the presentation within the allotted time (15 +/- 2 minutes)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adequately answer questions raised by the instructor and students&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It is a wise idea to practice your presentation from start to finish &amp;ldquo;live&amp;rdquo; to make sure your timing is correct. Students whose talks are wildly under/over time will find it difficult to achieve full credit.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="midterm-exams">Midterm Exams&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There will be three midterm exams throughout the semester. Each exam is designed to assess your understanding of the topics covered in the previous ~4 weeks of lectures. Each exam will be scheduled during a class period (see the &lt;a href="https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/schedule/">Course Schedule&lt;/a> for the precise date).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Exam makeup: If you are unable to attend class on the date of an exam, please contact the instructor &lt;em>before the exam date&lt;/em> to schedule a makeup exam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There will be no final exam (the ALMA proposal + review plays this role).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="alma-mock-tac-and-proposal">ALMA mock TAC and proposal&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Throughout the course, students will learn general telescope and grant proposal writing strategies, as well as strategies specific to the ALMA observatory. We will spend a few class periods describing the capabilities of the ALMA observatory, exploring how to write an ALMA proposal, and engaging in a mock TAC panel discussion using previously submitted (successful and unsuccessful) ALMA proposals.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="tac-reviews">TAC reviews&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Our class will simulate the dual-anonymous peer review process in a distributed fashion. In the actual ALMA review, for every proposal that the P.I. submits, they are sent (electronically) 10 proposals to review. Our review process will work as follows:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>You will receive approximately 5 proposals related to course topics we have covered.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are responsible for providing a written report describing (at minimum) the strengths and weaknesses of each proposal, at least two paragraphs in length. The ALMA guidelines for reviewers are available &lt;a href="https://almascience.eso.org/proposing/alma-proposal-review/guidelines-for-reviewers">here&lt;/a>. We also recommend reviewing the &lt;a href="https://jwst-docs.stsci.edu/jwst-opportunities-and-policies/james-webb-space-telescope-science-policies-group-and-review-information/panel-reports">JWST cycle 1&lt;/a> review criteria, which are similar and provide another data point for &amp;ldquo;what makes a good review.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You are responsible for evaluating the scientific merit of the proposal with a numerical score between 1 and 5 (1 being excellent, 5 being unsatisfactory).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The TAC reviews will be worth 5% of your final grade.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="alma-proposal">ALMA proposal&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>As a final course project, students will be responsible for preparing their own ALMA observing proposal using ALMA Cycle 8 capabilities and materials as a baseline (worth 20% of your final grade). Proposals will be due during the final examination period.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An overview of the ALMA proposal process is described in the &lt;a href="https://almascience.nrao.edu/proposing/proposers-guide">ALMA Cycle 8 Proposer&amp;rsquo;s Guide&lt;/a>. If you have any questions about preparing an ALMA proposal, answers can most likely be found in this document.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The following are some sections of the Proposer&amp;rsquo;s Guide that we recommend reading to understand this course project&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://almascience.nrao.edu/proposing/proposers-guide#section-4">1.2.1 Dual anonymous review&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://almascience.nrao.edu/proposing/proposers-guide#section-5">1.2.2 Distributed peer review&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://almascience.nrao.edu/proposing/proposers-guide#section-22">4. Proposal Planning&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://almascience.nrao.edu/proposing/proposers-guide#section-40">5. Proposal Preparation and submission&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The assignment will consist of preparing a Scientific Justification (&lt;a href="https://almascience.nrao.edu/proposing/proposers-guide#section-43">Section 5.3&lt;/a>) PDF &lt;em>only&lt;/em>. You may need to install the observing tool (OT) for help with your resolution/sensitivity calculations, but your submitted assignment does not need a cover sheet, technical justification, or abstract.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will grade your proposal following the spirit of the actual ALMA review critera. Specifically, your Scientific Justification should explicitly include:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a title&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a discussion of the overall scientific merit of the proposed investigations and their potential contribution to the advancement of scientific knowledge&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a clear description of the proposed observations. I.e.,
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>what targets will be observed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>at what angular resolution&lt;/li>
&lt;li>at what frequency (including continuum/spectral line)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>to what sensitivity (Jy for point sources, and Jy/beam or Jy/arcsec² for resolved sources)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a robust data analysis plan&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a discussion of why the capabilities of ALMA are required to carry out this science&lt;/li>
&lt;li>figures and tables supporting the proposal, as necessary&lt;/li>
&lt;li>references&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Your Scientific Justification should follow all rules for page limits and fonts, especially the requirements for 4 single-spaced pages (A4 or US letter size) in 12pt font. We suggest that you allow two pages for the science case and two pages for figures, tables, and references; however, you may allocate space as best you see fit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Your Scientific Justification should follow all guidelines for &lt;a href="https://almascience.nrao.edu/proposing/alma-proposal-review/dual-anonymous">dual-anonymous peer review&lt;/a> such that your PDF &lt;em>does not contain&lt;/em> any information that could be easily used to identify the proposer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>For full information, see the &lt;a href="https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/schedule/">Course Schedule&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If campus should be closed (e.g. for a weather-related event or COVID precautions), the instructor will provide instructions via email on course lecture format (possibly remote, keeping the same schedule) and examinations/assignments (due dates to be rescheduled &lt;em>no earlier than 48 hours&lt;/em> after closure announcement).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="academic-integrity">Academic Integrity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’ dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="disability-accommodation">Disability Accommodation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. Student Disability Resources (SDR) website provides contact information for every Penn State campus (Links to an external site.).

&lt;h1 id="single-dish-radio-telescopes">Single-dish radio telescopes&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In this section, we&amp;rsquo;ll cover existing single-dish radio telescopes and refresh our memory of basic telescope performance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The same
$$
\theta \approx \frac{\lambda}{D}
$$
applies for radio antennas. Take a \(\lambda = 1\;\mathrm{cm}\) observation, for example. Compared to an optical \(\lambda = 500\;\mathrm{nm}\) telescope the same size, the resolution will be a factor of
$$
\frac{1\;\mathrm{cm}}{500\;\mathrm{nm}} = 20,000
$$
worse. Yikes!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Radio astronomers are constantly trying to find ways to increase angular (spatial) resolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>One way is to build bigger telescopes, such as the Green Bank Telescope (100m diameter)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="https://public.nrao.edu/gallery/green-bank-telescope/">&lt;img src="gbt.jpg"
alt="The Green Bank Telescope (100m diameter) operates at radio wavelegths. Credit: NRAO/AUI/NSF"/>&lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>The Green Bank Telescope (100m diameter) operates at radio wavelegths. Credit: NRAO/AUI/NSF&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Another way is to work at higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths), e.g. sub-mm radio astronomy (IRAM 30m telescope)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="https://www.iram-institute.org/EN/30-meter-telescope.php">&lt;img src="iram.jpg"
alt="The IRAM 30m diameter telescope, which operates at sub-mm wavelengths. Credit: Wikipedia/IRAM-gre"/>&lt;/a>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>The IRAM 30m diameter telescope, which operates at sub-mm wavelengths. Credit: Wikipedia/IRAM-gre&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A final way is to use &lt;em>interferometry&lt;/em>, sometimes also at sub-mm wavelengths (ALMA), which will be the main focus of this course&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s easier to build larger telescopes at longer wavelengths because the tolerances required for the reflecting surface are less strict than at optical wavelengths. Though typically one must keep surface tolerances to within
$$
\sigma = \frac{\lambda_\mathrm{min}}{16},
$$
otherwise the efficiency of the antenna starts to decline substantially. For the 100 m diameter GBT operating at it&amp;rsquo;s highest frequency (100 GHz) or 3 mm, this translates to \(200\;\mu\mathrm{m}\), which is the thickness of two sheets of paper! That&amp;rsquo;s quite an engineering challenge, and is the reason why large, steerable dishes are difficult to build.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keeping telescopes fixed is one way to build a little bit bigger, such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-hundred-meter_Aperture_Spherical_Telescope">FAST&lt;/a>, which is a five hundred meter diameter fixed telescope in China. See also Arecibo, which unfortunately collapsed in December 2020. Eventually, though, the materials/engineering cost to building large single dish telescopes becomes prohibitive.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="single-dish-observations">Single dish observations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;beam&amp;rdquo; of a receiving antenna, or power pattern as a function of direction, can be calculated using the reciprocity theorems for transmitting and receiving antennas. These state that the far field electric field pattern \(f(l)\) is the Fourier transform (much more in lectures 2 and 3!) of the electric field illuminating the aperture of the telescope \(g(u)\).&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~sransom/web/Ch3.html#S1">&lt;img src="uniform-dish.png"

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>For large apertures, the nulls at \( l = \pm 1, 2, \ldots\) appear at the angles \(\theta \approx \lambda/D, 2 \lambda/D, \ldots\). In two dimensions, for a circular aperture, this is an Airy pattern.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="beam-pattern.png"
alt="A beam power pattern plotten in polar coordinates, demonstrating that the antenna can pick up power from sidelobes at range of angles. Credit: Tools of Radio Astronomy."/>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This is an idealized representation, but is still helpful. The beam can pick up power through sidelobes at a range of angles. Directional antennas help concentrate power in the main beam, but antennas with secondary stages (and thus supports, like most telescopes) create opportunities for ground radiation to reflect into the receiver.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can think of single-dish telescopes (unless they have a sophisticated, multi-pixel receiver) essentially as single-pixel devices. So to make a map of the sky, you would need to raster scan the telescope across the region of interest, reading out antenna temperature as a function of RA, Dec. To make a good (i.e., scientifically accurate) map, you should focus on Nyquist sampling the sky to a uniform sensitivity, usually through a hexagonal pattern of dithering. More advanced instruments may have an array of &amp;ldquo;feeds&amp;rdquo; in a focal plane (mirroring a set of &amp;ldquo;pixels&amp;rdquo;), but this is still a small number of pixels compared to a typical CCD (e.g., 25 or 36 compared to \(2046^2\)).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="image-units">Image Units&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="radiative-transfer-recap">Radiative transfer recap&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>What are the units of the sky, and the images we make as representations of it?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the most useful quantities from radiative transfer is \(I_\nu\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\(I_\nu \) is the &lt;em>specific intensity&lt;/em> of radiation, you can think of it as the energy carried along by an infinitesimal &amp;ldquo;bundle&amp;rdquo; of rays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has dimensions of:
$$
\mathrm{energy}\; (\mathrm{time})^{-1} \;(\mathrm{area})^{-1} \;(\mathrm{solid\,angle})^{-1} \; (\mathrm{frequency})^{-1}
$$
in CGS units, we would write
$$
\mathrm{ergs}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\;\mathrm{ster}^{-1}\;\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}
$$
In astronomical settings, I&amp;rsquo;ve always seen \(I_\nu\) referred to as the &amp;ldquo;specific intensity.&amp;rdquo; In non-astronomy settings, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen &amp;ldquo;spectral intensity.&amp;rdquo; If \(I_\nu\) is integrated over all frequencies, it&amp;rsquo;s called the radiant intensity \(I\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\(I_\nu \) can be a little mind-bending to think about&amp;hellip; it can be a function of&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>3D space \(\vec{x}\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>direction \(\vec{\Omega}\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>frequency&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Intensity itself is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> a vector quantity; rather it is a scalar field that &lt;em>is&lt;/em> function of position and direction \(I_\nu(\vec{x}, \vec{\Omega})\). Rybicki and Lightman write the angular direction vector as \(\vec{\Omega}\) and the solid angle surrounding that vector as \(\mathrm{d}\Omega\).&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="rybicky_lightman_1.2.png"

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>If we have a defined reference frame, we would probably write \(\vec{\Omega}\) as a vector in spherical coordinates and define the components along \(\hat{\phi}\) and \(\hat{\theta}\) and let \(\mathrm{d}\Omega = d\phi \sin \theta d\theta\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we are making astrophysical &lt;em>observations&lt;/em> from the earth, though,
we are making or acquiring images of regions of the celestial sky. So we generally talk of \(I_\nu(\alpha, \delta)\), where \(\alpha\) and \(\delta\) are R.A. and declination offsets from some direction, respectively. We&amp;rsquo;re always looking from the same place (at least compared to the size of the universe), so we don&amp;rsquo;t worry about specifying position within 3D space. But if we went to the Andromeda Galaxy and started mapping the celestial sky, we would need to, then. In the end though, images are have the same units because they represent specific intensity. It&amp;rsquo;s very common to refer to \(I_\nu(\alpha, \delta)\) as the &lt;em>surface brightness&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="solid-angle.png"
alt="When we&amp;amp;rsquo;re discussing images of astronomical sources, we&amp;amp;rsquo;re usually using RA \(\alpha\) and Dec \(\delta\).

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3 id="flux">Flux&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Once you&amp;rsquo;ve defined \(I_\nu\), then it&amp;rsquo;s relatively easy to calculate quantities like energy density, flux, momentum, etc, as integrals of the specific intensity field.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Flux&lt;/strong> is where you integrate out the angular dependence:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
F_\nu = \int I_\nu \cos \theta d \Omega
$$
(intensity passing through some differential area \(dA\), lowered by the effective angle).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\(F_\nu\) has units of
$$
\mathrm{ergs}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\;\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}
$$
(i.e., angular dependence has been integrated out).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most astrophysical sources produce significantly less energy in radio waves compared to higher frequency bands, and so the raw CGS unit can be quite cumbersome. To make this easier, astronomers use a unit called the &amp;ldquo;Jansky,&amp;rdquo; which is defined as&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
1\,\mathrm{Jy} = 10^{-23}~\mathrm{ergs}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\;\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Jansky is a unit of flux.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How do we report specific intensities/surface brightnesses for radio sources, then?&lt;/strong> We can, reintroduce the &amp;ldquo;per solid angle&amp;rdquo; to the Jansky, for example
$$
\mathrm{Jy}\;\mathrm{arcsec}^{-2}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Later on the course, we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about \(\mathrm{Jy}\;\mathrm{beam}^{-1}\), which another unit of surface brightness/specific intensity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other units of surface brightness that you might encounter at other wavelengths include \(\mathrm{mag}\;\mathrm{arcsec}^{-2}\) (optical) and \(\mathrm{MJy}\;\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\) (infrared).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Questions for review&lt;/strong>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What is the name of \(I_\nu\), and what are its units?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is the name of \(F_\nu\), and what are its units?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If we made an astronomical observation of a &amp;ldquo;point source,&amp;rdquo; would we report \(I_\nu\) or \(F_\nu\)?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What about for a spatially resolved source?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Is a Jansky a unit for \(I_\nu\) or \(F_\nu\)?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h3 id="from-cosmic-sources-only">From Cosmic Sources only&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>brightness temperature&lt;/strong>: \(T_b\), the temperature corresponding to the specific intensity if we used the full form of the Planck formula
$$
I_\nu = \frac{2 h \nu^3}{c^2} \frac{1}{\exp{(h \nu / k T_b)} - 1}
$$&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>antenna temperature&lt;/strong>: the temperature corresponding to the specific intensity if we were in the Rayleigh-Jeans domain. Added benefit that specific intensity is &lt;em>linearly related&lt;/em> to antenna temperature and makes it easy to substitute one for the other.
$$
T_A(\nu) = \frac{c^2}{2 k \nu^2} I_\nu
$$&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In the field of radio astronomy, be aware that one frequently combines temperatures in other interesting ways. One can express random noise power in terms of an effective temperature
$$
P = k T \Delta \nu
$$
where \(\Delta \nu\) is the bandwidth of the observation. Here the power is equal to the noise power delivered to a &lt;strong>matched load&lt;/strong> by a resistor at physical temperature \(T\). By matched load, we mean we connect a resistor to the input terminals of a linear amplifier. The fact that this resistor has some temperature (i.e., we haven&amp;rsquo;t cooled it to absolute zero&amp;hellip;) means that the thermal motion of the electrons will produce a random, variable current \(i(t)\) input to the amplifier. The mean value of this current is zero, but the root mean squared value is non-zero, and this represents a non-zero power. I.e., you can draw (some) power from a resistor at room temperature, purely from thermal motions. The situation is not dissimilar to the random walk of a particle in Brownian motion. For more details, see &lt;em>Tools of Radio Astronomy&lt;/em>, Chapter 1.8.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Antenna temperature&lt;/strong> \(T_A\) the component of the power received by the antenna from &lt;em>cosmic sources&lt;/em>. It has the same interpretation as before (though we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about beam dilution in a second).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Receiver temperature&lt;/strong> \(T_R\) the component of the power from internal noise of the receiver components themselves, ground radiation, atmospheric emission, etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>System temperature&lt;/strong> \(T_S = T_A + T_R\) is the sum of receiver temperature and antenna temperature. It&amp;rsquo;s the one power number coming out of the backend of your telescope. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you to calibrate \(T_R\) accurately enough to measure \(T_A\).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In any observation, you will have your cosmic signal of interest and several contributions of noise (see &lt;em>Essential Radio Astronomy&lt;/em>, Ch. 3.6.1)
$$
T_S=T_\mathrm{cmb}+T_\mathrm{rsb}+T_A + [1−\exp(−\tau_A)] T_\mathrm{atm}+T_\mathrm{spill}+T_r+ \ldots
$$
such as the CMB, other galactic background sources, the atmosphere, spillover radiation from the ground, the temperature of the radiometer itself (hopefully cryogenically cooled), etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the limit that \(T_A \ll T_S\) (most astronomy situations, unfortunately!), we have
$$
S/N \approx C \frac{T_A}{T_S} \sqrt{\Delta \nu \Delta t}
$$
where \(C\) is a constant of proportionality greater than or equal to 1, and \(\Delta t\) is the integration time. If we let \(\Delta \nu \approx 1\;\mathrm{GHz}\) and \(\Delta t \approx 1\;\mathrm{h}\), then we can get \(\sqrt{\Delta \nu \Delta t} \approx 10^6\), allowing us to detect a signal which is less than \(10^{-6}\) the system noise. A great illustration of this capability is the COBE satellite that studied CMB anisotropies with brightness temperatures \(&amp;lt; 10^{-7}\) that of the system temperature. To achieve these contrasts, however, it&amp;rsquo;s important to keep systematics under control, otherwise the S/N scaling won&amp;rsquo;t hold!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="beam-dilution">Beam dilution&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In previous lectures, we&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about specific intensity \(I_\nu(\Omega)\) as a &amp;ldquo;known&amp;rdquo; quantity of direction (e.g., R.A., Dec.) and used antenna temperature \(T_A\) as a linear proxy for its specification. For the following discussion, we&amp;rsquo;re going to move into the realm of observations, and discuss the ways \(T_A\) can be an unfaithful proxy for the &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; specific intensity distribution or brightness temperature. we&amp;rsquo;ll use the symbol \(T_b(\Omega)\) to denote the &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; brightness/antenna temperature, assuming we&amp;rsquo;re in the Rayleigh-Jeans limit, and redefine \(T_A\) to mean the response of the telescope to the cosmic radiation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we&amp;rsquo;re doing observations, we don&amp;rsquo;t always have access to the highest resolution version of \(T_b(\Omega)\), but rather we have access to a quantity which is the true \(T_b(\Omega)\) convolved with the beam of the telescope, which is the implication of \(T_A\) for this discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="beam-dilution.png"

&lt;h4 id="large-fully-resolved-source">large (fully resolved) source&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>[Draw a smooth cloud with the beam overlaid as a small circle].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the limit that we are observing a source that subtends a solid angle much larger than the beam of the antenna,
$$
\Omega_S &amp;gt; \Omega_A
$$
the convolution of the beam doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, we&amp;rsquo;re still sensing approximately the same \(T_b(\Omega)\) such that
$$
T_A(\Omega) \approx T_b(\Omega).
$$
If the source is in LTE, then we also have that \(T_A \approx T\).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="small-unresolved-source">small (unresolved) source&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If the source is more compact than the antenna beam,
$$
\Omega_S &amp;lt; \Omega_A,
$$
then the measured antenna temperature is basically the &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; intensity averaged over the area of the main beam. This lowers the measured antenna temperature by a factor
$$
\frac{T_A}{T_b} = \frac{\Omega_S}{\Omega_A}
$$
where the ratio \(\frac{\Omega_S}{\Omega_A}\) is called the &lt;strong>beam filling factor&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, you could have a compact source with \(T_b = 10^4\) K, but if it only fills 1% of the beam solid angle then you would measure an antenna temperature of 100 K. If you took your observations at face-value (and assumed LTE), then you would incorrectly conclude that the source is 100x cooler than it actually is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beam dilution also applies to observations of sources that have &lt;em>structure&lt;/em> on spatial scales below the observable limit, which, to be honest, is going to be most astrophysical sources of interest. For example, consider a gas filament in a star-forming region.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Radio-bright, spatially concentrated regions will be &amp;ldquo;smeared out&amp;rdquo; by the beam. If you wanted to use antenna temperature (and assume LTE) to estimate the physical conditions of the gas filament, you do so at the peril of measuring incorrect temperatures. The unfortunate reality here is that, without higher resolution images to guide you (which sometimes exist at optical or infrared wavelengths), it&amp;rsquo;s quite difficult to estimate how badly your measurements are affected by beam dilution.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Dark cloud&amp;rdquo; defined via magnitudes of optical extinction (\(A_V &amp;gt; 5\,\mathrm{mag}\))&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Cores&amp;rdquo; are self-gravitating density peaks within an isolated dark cloud, which have masses from \(0.3 - 10\,M_\odot\), each is likely to form a single star or a binary star&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Within giant molecular clouds (GMCs), &lt;strong>clump&lt;/strong> refers to self-gravitating regions with masses as large as \(10^3\,M_\odot\).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>clumps&lt;/strong> may or may not be forming stars. Those that are are called &lt;em>star-forming clumps&lt;/em>. Each clump with generally contain a number of cores.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="core-collapse-to-form-stars">Core collapse to form stars&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When the core becomes gravitationally unstable, it will begin to collapse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The free-fall timescale is
$$
\tau = \sqrt{\frac{3 \pi}{32 G \rho}}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In initial stages, radiative cooling in the molecular lines keeps the gas cool. This means that gas pressure remains unimportant during this phase so the matter can move inward nearly in free-fall.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In interior of the core, the density is higher, and so the free-fall time is shorter there. This leads the core to collapse in an &amp;ldquo;inside-out&amp;rdquo; manner, where the center collapses on itself first, and the outer material falls onto the central matter later.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As we discussed in the previous lecture, molecular clouds appear to have magnetic energies comparable to the kinetic energy (from turbulent motions) and an abundance of angular momentum that needs to be shed before collapse can complete.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The fact that stars do form implies that ambipolar diffusion (or some other process) is able to reduce the magnetic field to below some critical value such that it no longer prevents gravitational collapse.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Ambipolar diffusion&lt;/strong>: Normally, we assume that the magnetic field is &amp;ldquo;frozen&amp;rdquo; into the plasma. Indeed, the magnetic field is coupled to charged particles (electrons, ions, and charged dust grains). But, the plasma can drift relative to the neutral gas as they become uncoupled. In a molecular cloud, where the fractional ionization is very low, neutral particles will only rarely encounter charged particles, so they aren&amp;rsquo;t completely hindered in their collapse. The magnetic force on the plasma is balanced against the force resulting from collisions of charged particles with neutrals. And so we get a timescale for the magnetic field to &amp;ldquo;slip&amp;rdquo; out of the clump. For high densities \(n_\mathrm{H} \gtrsim 10^5\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\) the timescale is short enough \(\lesssim 3 \times 10^6\,\mathrm{yr}\) such that this mechanism may be able to reduce the magnetic flux in a contracting clump.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Infalling gas will generally have nonzero angular momentum, and as long as it remains relatively cold, it will collapse to form a rotationally supported disk. The material with the lowest specific angular momentum will be collected in a central protostar.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The dominant sources of energy are&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>gravitational energy released as material is added to the protostar and it contracts&lt;/li>
&lt;li>energy released when the protostar starts to burn deuterium, and then hydrogen (main sequence)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="protostar-classes">Protostar classes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Protostellar systems (protostars and their disks) are conventionally divided into four different classes based on the overall shape of their infrared spectrum, characterized by their spectral index
$$
\alpha \equiv \frac{d \log(\lambda F_\lambda)}{d \log \lambda}.
$$
i.e.,
$$
\nu F_\nu \propto \nu^{-\alpha}.
$$
Observationally, this is usually calculated using observations done at 2.2 microns (K-band) and 10 microns (N-band), which are observable from the ground.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="initial-mass-function-imf">Initial Mass Function (IMF)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If we go to a large star-forming region like the Orion Nebula Cluster, we can tabulate all of the stellar masses that we see and estimate the distribution of initial stellar masses, called the &lt;strong>initial mass function&lt;/strong> (IMF).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Starting with Salpeter in 1955, many people have studied the IMF in different regions of the Milky Way and other galaxies. There is no immediate reason why we should expect the IMF to be universal (e.g., metallicity? turbulence? magnetic fields?), but studies seem to show remarkable uniformity from region to region. Thus far, any systematic differences appear to be very small.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="fig_42_1.jpg"

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s hard to estimate the IMF at the high mass end because high-mass stars are rare (and in any SF region, you may only have a few). It&amp;rsquo;s hard to estimate the IMF at the low mass end because low-mass stars are faint. But over the range \(0.01 to 50\,M_\odot\), there appears to be reasonable agreement between studies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The mass per logarithmic mass interval peaks around \(0.5\,M_\odot\), meaning that solar-mass stars are not the most common.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The IMF can also be used to estimate core-collapse supernova rates. If all \(M &amp;gt; 8\,M_\odot\) stars become Type II supernovae, then the Milky Way star formation rate of \(1.3\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\) corresponds to a Type II supernova rate of about one every 70 yrs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="star-formation-rates">Star Formation Rates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>How to estimate how many stars are being formed in our Galaxy?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Massive stars are highly luminous and create H II regions, which can be observed at large distances.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We can use observed number of high-mass stars and theoretical estimates of stellar lifetimes to estimate the rate at which massive stars are being formed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Then use the IMF to estimate the total rate at which stars are being formed&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Related to this question is how to calculate the rate of ionizing photons in our Galaxy.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>N II emission (related to H II abundance)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>COBE data of [N II] 205 micron line&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Free-free radio emission (WMAP)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>using these combined values, the total rate of star formation in the Milky Way (averaged over the past 3 Myr, which is the lifetime of early O-type stars), is about one solar mass per year.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="schmidt-kennicutt-law">Schmidt-Kennicutt Law&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The total mass of molecular gas in the MW is \(10^9\,M_\odot\). If we say the typical density is \(n_\mathrm{H} \approx 50\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\), then the free-fall time of that gas would be about \(6 \times 10^6\,\mathrm{yr}\), so the maximum rate at which stars could be made would be
$$
\dot{M}&lt;em>\mathrm{ff} = \frac{M&lt;/em>\mathrm{tot}}{\tau_\mathrm{ff}} \approx 200\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}
$$
the actual SF rate is two orders of magnitude below this. Why?&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>most of the mass in giant molecular clouds is not undergoing free-fall collapse&lt;/li>
&lt;li>even in the regions that do collapse, only a fraction of the gas ends up in stars&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Big question in ISM theory is &lt;em>why the SF rate has the observed value&lt;/em> that it does. This is complicated because it involves&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>excitation and damping of MHD turbulence in molecular clouds&lt;/li>
&lt;li>transport of angular momentum out of contracting regions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>ambipolar diffusion to remove magnetic flux from contracting regions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>important effects of &amp;ldquo;feedback&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;how outflows and radiation from protostars and stars on the surrounding gas, either stimulating or suppressing further star formation.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Star-formation is the result of gravitational collapse, so one expects the specific star formation rate (SF rate per unit of gas mass) to be larger in higher density regions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Schmidt (1959)&lt;/em> proposed that the star formation rate per volume varied as a power of the local density \(\rho\). The volume density is difficult to determine from afar, so &lt;em>Kennicut (1998)&lt;/em> examined the relationship between global star formation in a galaxy and \(\Sigma_\mathrm{gas,disk}\), which is the gas surface density averaged over the &amp;ldquo;optical disk&amp;rdquo; of the galaxy. He found that the star formation rate per unit area varied as
$$
\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR, disk} = (2.5 \pm 0.7) \times 10^{-4} \left ( \frac{\Sigma_\mathrm{gas, disk}}{M_\odot\,\mathrm{pc}^{-2}} \right)\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{kpc}^{-2}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is referred to as the &lt;strong>Schmidt-Kennicut&lt;/strong> Law, and describes the &lt;em>global star formation rate&lt;/em> of a galaxy. It works remarkably well from the low gas surface densities of gas-poor spiral disks to the very high surface densities in the cores of luminous starburst galaxies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can create an even tighter relationship if you consider the surface density of &lt;em>molecular gas&lt;/em> and average over smaller volumes (for nearby, well-resolved galaxies).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Gravitational Collapse and Star Formation: Theory</title><link>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/29-star-formation-theory/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/29-star-formation-theory/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://psu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/Astro+542A+Lecture+Nov+15/1_4xd4rf28">Zoom link&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Gravity is the force responsible for gathering gas into self-gravitating structures, ranging in size from stars to giant molecular cloud complexes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Star formation involves extreme &lt;em>compression&lt;/em>: drawing a gas cloud from size \(10^{18}\) cm down to the size of a star \(10^{11}\) cm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This lecture deals with the conditions necessary for gravitational collapse to occur (and be consistent w/ observations).&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Gravity must overcome the resistance of pressure (both gas pressure and magnetic pressure)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Angular momentum must be transferred to nearby material&lt;/li>

&lt;p>$$
\rho = \rho_0 + \rho_1

&lt;p>etc..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Plugging these into the equations, we get
$$
\frac{\partial \rho_1}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{v}_0 \cdot \nabla \rho_1 + \boldsymbol{v}_1 \cdot \nabla \rho_0 = - \rho_1 \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{v}_0 - \rho_0 \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{v}_1

and
$$
\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{v}_1}{\partial t} + (\boldsymbol{v}_0 \cdot \nabla) \boldsymbol{v}_1 + (\boldsymbol{v}_1 \cdot \nabla) \boldsymbol{v}_0 = \frac{\rho_1}{\rho_0^2} \nabla p_0 - \frac{1}{\rho_0} \nabla p_1 - \nabla \phi_1

and

\frac{\partial \boldsymbol{v}_1}{\partial t} + (\boldsymbol{v}_0 \cdot \nabla) \boldsymbol{v}_1 + (\boldsymbol{v}_1 \cdot \nabla) \boldsymbol{v}_0 = - c_s^2 \nabla \left ( \frac{\rho_1}{\rho_0} \right) - \nabla \phi_1,
$$
which gives us three equations for three unknowns \(\rho_1, \boldsymbol{v}_1, \phi_1\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Jeans (1928) considered the problem of a uniform, stationary gas, having \(\nabla \rho_0 = 0\), \(\nabla \phi_0 = 0\), \(\boldsymbol{v}_0 = 0\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can rearrange this to
$$
\frac{\partial^2 \rho_1}{\partial t^2} = c_s^2 \nabla^2 \rho_1 + (4 \pi G \rho_0) \rho_1
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, let&amp;rsquo;s consider perturbations in plane-wave form
$$
\rho_1 \propto \exp [i (\boldsymbol{k} \cdot \boldsymbol{r} - \omega t)]
$$
which has the dispersion relation
$$
\omega^2 = k^2 c_s^2 - 4 \pi G \rho_0
$$
if we define
$$
k_\mathrm{J}^2 \equiv (4 \pi G \rho_0)/c_s^2,
$$
then we have the dispersion relation
$$
\omega^2 = (k^2 - k_\mathrm{J}^2) c_s^2.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, \(\omega\) is real if and only if \(k \geq k_\mathrm{J}\), i.e., the wave number is larger than the Jeans wavenumber.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Otherwise, if \(k &amp;lt; k_\mathrm{J}\), then \(\omega\) becomes imaginary, which corresponds to exponential growth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So the &lt;strong>Jeans instability&lt;/strong> occurs for wavelengths
$$
\lambda &amp;gt; \lambda_\mathrm{J} \equiv \frac{2 \pi}{k_\mathrm{J}} = \left ( \frac{\pi c_s^2}{G \rho_0} \right)^{1/2}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, perturbations greater than this scale grow.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can define a corresponding &lt;strong>Jeans mass&lt;/strong>
$$
M_\mathrm{J} \equiv \frac{4 \pi}{3} \rho_0 \left ( \frac{\lambda_\mathrm{J}}{2} \right)^3
$$
which, when you plug in typical densities of quiescent dark clouds, you get something around a third of a solar mass.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The exponential &amp;ldquo;growth time&amp;rdquo; is
$$
\tau_\mathrm{J} = \frac{1}{k_\mathrm{J} c_s} \approx 10^4\,\mathrm{yrs}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Flaws in the preceeding Jeans analysis&lt;/strong>: the assumption that \(\nabla \phi_0 = 0\) everywhere is completely unphysical, because it implies that \(\nabla^2 \phi_0 = 0\) everywhere, which implies \(\rho_0 = 0\) everywhere, i.e., we&amp;rsquo;re in a vacuum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, for finite systems, rigorous analyses yield instability criteria that are close to Jeans&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="parker-instability">Parker instability&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We won&amp;rsquo;t have time to talk about it today, but there is an analogous analysis called &lt;strong>Parker Instability&lt;/strong> which treats magnetic fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="nonrotating-nonmagnetized-isothermal-core">Nonrotating, nonmagnetized isothermal core&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Consider a spherical &amp;ldquo;core&amp;rdquo; with mass \(M\), radius \(R\), having external pressure \(p_0\) at the surface. The gravitational energy can be written as&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
E_\mathrm{grav} = - \frac{3}{5} a \frac{GM^2}{R}
$$
where \(a\) is a dimensionless factor that is 1 for uniform density and is \(a &amp;gt; 1\) if the density is centrally peaked.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the gas is in equilibrium with \(v=0\), then the virial theorem requires that
$$
0 = 3 M c_s^2 - 4 \pi p_0 R^3 - \frac{3}{5}a \frac{G M^2}{R}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The external pressure \(p_0\) must be given by
$$
p_0 = \frac{1}{4 \pi R^3} \left [ 3 M c_s^2 - \frac{3}{5} a \frac{G M^2}{R} \right].
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the external pressure \(p_0\) is small, then equilibrium has
$$
R \approx \frac{a G M}{5 c_s^2}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a fixed mass \(M\), the external pressure has a maximum allowed value such that the equation holds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can turn this around, and instead ask for a given pressure \(p_0\), what is the maximum core mass that can be in equilibrium?
$$
M_\mathrm{BE}(p_0) = 0.26 \left ( \frac{T}{10\,\mathrm{K}} \right)^2 \left (\frac{10^6\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\,\mathrm{K}}{p_0/k} \right)^{1/2}\, M_\odot
$$
where \(M_\mathrm{BE}\) is the &lt;strong>Bonner-Ebert&lt;/strong> mass, i.e., pressure-bounded isothermal sphere. The Bonner-Ebert mass differs from the Jeans mass by only order unity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Only cores with \(M &amp;gt; M_\mathrm{BE}\) are unstable to collapse, which provides a nice explanation to the fact that &amp;ldquo;typical&amp;rdquo; stars have masses of \(\sim 1 M_\odot\)&amp;mdash;only cores larger than this are unstable to collapse and will become stars.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="angular-momentum-problem">Angular momentum problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Self-gravitating cores will generally have non-zero angular momentum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, if the cloud were to contract while preserving constant angular momentum, then the rotational kinetic energy will stop contraction of a cloud at a radius of \(10^{16}\,\mathrm{cm}\), which is about five orders of magnitude larger than the size of a star!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that a collapsing cloud cannot contract to anything approaching the size of a star if angular momentum is conserved.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order for the core to continue contracting, needs to transfer nearly all of its angular momentum to nearby material. The two mechanisms that can do this are&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>gravitational torques: non-axisymmetric density patters in the gas (e.g., spiral arms), then gravitational torques could remove angular momentum from the clump on a time scale of order the dynamical time. But, it&amp;rsquo;s unclear how non-axisymmetric a collapsing clump might be.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>magnetic torques: if the magnetic field is contributing to the support of the system against its self-gravity, then the magnetic braking time can be of order the dynamical time.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Following our discussion of the physics of shock-fronts, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about how the energy deposition gets there in the first place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Explosions are a great way to deposit a lot of energy into a tiny volume of gas over a short period of time. The first nuclear fission bombs provided an urgent need for study, and independently, Leonid Sedov and Geoffrey Taylor found analytic self-similar solutions for the expansion of a non-radiative spherical shock front.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What does self-similar mean? Basically, &lt;em>scale-invariance&lt;/em>, like a power law or fractal nature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>Sedov-Taylor&lt;/strong> solution can be applied to the explosion of fission bombs \(10^{20}\,\mathrm{ergs}\) or supernovae \(10^{51}\,\mathrm{erg}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two types of supernovae&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>core-collapse&lt;/strong>: powered by gravitational collapse of the dense core of an evolved massive star&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>thermonuclear&lt;/strong>: powered by runaway nuclear fusion in a degenerate white dwarf&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="supernovae-remnants">Supernovae Remnants&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s consider a core-collapse for now.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Such a core-collapse explosion produces \(\sim 10^{53}\,\mathrm{erg}\) in neutrinos. Because neutrinos have a gigantic mean-free path for interactions with low-density baryonic matter, this energy is mostly lost and &lt;em>not&lt;/em> deposited in the ISM.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The SNe also produces about \(\sim 10^{49}\,\mathrm{ergs}\) in photons, which is also mostly lost.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The main energy that is deposited is in the form of kinetic energy of the expanding ejecta.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s take \(M_\mathrm{ej} \sim 10\,M_\odot\) as typical ejecta mass, and \(u_\mathrm{ej} \sim 3000\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\), which implies a kinetic energy of
$$
E = M_\mathrm{ej} u_\mathrm{ej}^2 \sim 10^{51}\,\mathrm{erg}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[Though thermonuclear SNe have a lower ejecta mass, their ejecta speed is higher, and so they have approximately a similar kinetic energy.]&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="free-expansion-phase">Free-expansion phase&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The first stage after an SNe explosion is the &lt;em>free-expansion&lt;/em> phase, where the ejecta travel ballistically outward at nearly constant speed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ejecta are only slowed down significantly when they have swept up a mass of ISM gas comparable to the mass of the ejecta, which occurs at
$$
r_\mathrm{sweep} = \left ( \frac{3 M_\mathrm{ej}}{4 \pi \rho_1} \right)^{1/3} = 4.1\,\mathrm{pc} \left ( \frac{M_\mathrm{ej}}{10\,M_\odot} \right)^{1/3} \left ( \frac{n_\mathrm{H}}{1\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}} \right)^{-1/3}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For most conditions, we expect this to last about 1000 yrs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The initial speed of the ejecta (3000 km/s) is much greater than the sound speed in the ISM gas (~ 1 km/s), so this creates a shockwave, like a bullet moving through the Earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere (Mach number &amp;raquo; 1).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Immediately behind the shock front, the shock-heated gas has a very high pressure \(P_2\). But, the gas of the ejecta is also becoming less dense as it expands (and less hot). When the pressure within the ejecta becomes small relative to the pressure of the recently shock-heated interstellar gas, a reverse shock propagates backward toward the center of the SNe remnant, shock-heating the ejecta.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cartoon of the free-expansion phase:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>strong, spherical shock is expanding outward into the ISM&lt;/li>
&lt;li>behind the shock, is a layer of hot, relatively dense gas, consisting of mixed ejecta and interstellar gas&lt;/li>
&lt;li>interior to that is a core of hot, low-density gas consisting of ejecta shock-heated by the reverse shock&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Real SNe remnants may be more complicated, for example, the Crab Nebula seems to have speed up its expansion, possibly accelerated by the magnetized pulsar at the heart of the nebula.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="sedov-taylor-phase">Sedov-Taylor Phase&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>After the free-expansion phase is over, the remnant transitions into the &lt;strong>Sedov-Taylor&lt;/strong> phase, also considered the &lt;strong>blastwave phase&lt;/strong>. In this phase,&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the amount of shocked ISM gas is much greater than the original mass of the ejecta, so the shock front no longer depends on \(M_\mathrm{ej}\).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The amount of energy radiated by photons is much smaller than the initial kinetic energy \(E\), though, so things still depend on the initial \(E\) deposited.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>\(P_2 \gg P_1\), so properties of the shock don&amp;rsquo;t depend on surrounding medium&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Properties of shock &lt;em>do&lt;/em> depend on \(\rho_1\), the &lt;em>density&lt;/em> of the surrounding medium&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The two important quantities, \(E\) and \(\rho_1\), cannot be combined to form a characteristic length scale or timescale for the problem. And, it&amp;rsquo;s not relevant to introduce physical constants because&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>gravity is negligible: \(G\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the shock is non-relativistic and non-radiative: \(c\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>classical (not quantum): \(\hbar\)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So the conclusion is that the solution to the shock propagation is scale-free, or &lt;strong>self-similar&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One class of self-similar solutions are power-laws, so let&amp;rsquo;s try writing the radius as a function of time like
$$
r_\mathrm{sh}(t) = A E^\alpha \rho_1^\beta t^\eta
$$
where \(A\) is a dimensionless pre-factor. It turns out that in order to get an expression with the correct units, the exponents are such that
$$
r_\mathrm{sh} = A \left ( \frac{E t^2}{\rho_1} \right)^{1/5}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And we can solve for the expansion speed of the shock front
$$
u_\mathrm{sh} = \frac{2}{5} A \left ( \frac{E}{\rho_1 t^3} \right)^{1/5} = \frac{2}{5} \frac{r_\mathrm{sh}}{t} \propto r_\mathrm{sh}^{-3/2}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These equations can be applied to supernova remnants in the Sedov-Taylor phase and, along with a distance estimate, be used to calculate the age of the remnant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sedov and Taylor both found solutions for the density, velocity, and pressure as a function of time
$$
\rho(r, t) = \rho_1 f(x),
$$
and
$$
u(r, t) = \frac{r_\mathrm{sh}(t)}{t} g(x),
$$
and
$$
P(r, t) = \frac{\rho_1 r_\mathrm{sh}^2(t)}{t^2} h(x),
$$
where \(f, g, h\) are dimensionless functions of the dimensionless radius \(x = r/r_\mathrm{sh}(t)\). Using the conservation equations of momentum, energy, and entropy for a spherically symmetric system, you get three differential equations that you can solve for \(f, g, h\) as a function of \(x\), and there you go. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to do in practice.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Notice the steep rise in density as a function of radius.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Q&lt;/strong>: What does this imply about the structure of a supernova remnant?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A&lt;/strong>: most of the mass lies in a relatively thin outer layer. About 50% of the remnants mass likes within the outermost 17% of its volume.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The Sedov-Taylor phase lasts until the amount of energy radiated by the cooling gas is comparable to the initial energy \(E\). Because free-free cooling at very high temperatures is not &lt;em>that&lt;/em> effective, the gas won&amp;rsquo;t cool that much until \(T_2\), the temperature in the hot dense region just behind the shock, drops below \(2 \times 10^7\) K, at which point collisionally excited line radiation will take over.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This gives us a handle on understanding supernova remnants that have ages between 1,000 yr and 40,000 yr. Once radiative losses become important at \(t \sim t_\mathrm{cool}\), a dense shell forms behind the shock (as seen in the following figure), and the supernova remnant enters the &lt;strong>snowplow phase&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="Fig5-5.jpg"

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3 id="snowplow-phase">Snowplow phase&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the snowplow phase, the dense shell contains most of the mass of the SNe remnant, so its mass at time \(t \sim t_\mathrm{cool}\) is
$$
M_\mathrm{sh} \sim \frac{4 \pi}{3} \rho_1 r_\mathrm{cool}^3 \sim 1600\,M_\odot
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This phase is called the snowplow phase because, just as a snowplow does, it scoops up additional mass as it expands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this phase, most of the mass is in the dense shell. The inner region still contains gas at very high temperatures. Even though it&amp;rsquo;s low density, this gas has high pressure, which helps push the dense shell outward. So, this is called the &lt;strong>pressure-assisted snowplow phase&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s briefly analyze the forces at play. Let \(P_i\) be the mean pressure within the hot, low-density interior of the SNe remnant. This gas cannot cool effectively, so its pressure only drops through adiabatic expansion
$$
P V^\gamma = \mathrm{const}
$$
meaning the pressure drops as
$$
P_i \propto V^{-\gamma} \propto r_\mathrm{sh}^{-3 \gamma}.
$$
Positing that there exists a power-law solution, and using conservation of momentum, we can approximate the expansion of the shell in this phase as
$$
r_\mathrm{sh}(t) = r_\mathrm{cool} \left ( \frac{t}{t_\mathrm{cool}} \right)^{2/7}
$$
(order of magnitude 58 pc in this phase).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And expansion speed
$$
u_\mathrm{sh} = \frac{2}{7} \frac{r_\mathrm{cool}}{t_\mathrm{cool}} \left ( \frac{t}{t_\mathrm{cool}} \right)^{-5/7}
$$
of order 16 km/s at 1 Myr.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Eventually, the expansion speed drops to the sound speed of the surrounding medium, and the shell degenerates into an expanding sound wave, of order 35 Myr after the SNe, and shell radius 160 pc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, hopefully this combination of the free-expansion phase, the Sedov-Taylor phase, and the snowplow phase has provided a schematic for understanding how the hot SNe blow hot, low-density bubbles surrounded by dense shells. Which, over timescales of 35 Myr, grow to be 300 pc in diameter. These bubbles from SNe remnants are the origin of the hot ionized medium.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Fluids and Shocks</title><link>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/27-fluid-dynamics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/27-fluid-dynamics/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://psu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/Astro+542A+Nov+10/1_v4bhqjbe">Zoom link&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Hot Ionized Medium&lt;/strong> occupies about half the volume of the ISM, but, because it is low-density, it is only a few percent by mass.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The HIM is hot because it has been shock-heated by supernovae explosions, which means it consists of a set of bubbles. For example, we live in the Local Bubble, which is 50 pc in radius and is thought to have been created by one or more SNe that went off 2 Myr ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The gas in the local bubble has \(T \sim 10^6\) K and density \(n_H \sim 0.004\;\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The bubble does have cooler and denser regions within itself, of course. The Sun is near the edge of the Local Interstellar Cloud, which is 10 pc across and has properties consistent with the warm ionized medium (WIM, \(T\sim 8000\) K, \(n_H \sim 0.2\;\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\)).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this lecture, we&amp;rsquo;re going to dig into how shock fronts (in particular, those from SNe) can heat the gas of the ISM.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="shock-front">Shock front&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A &lt;strong>shock front&lt;/strong> is a thin boundary between two regions of gas with very different densities, pressures, and bulk velocities. It will naturally tend to form from a sound wave travelling through gas.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="Fig5-1.jpg"

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>For an adiabatic process, like the propagation of a low-amplitude sound wave, the equation of state is given by
$$
P(\rho) = P_0 \left ( \frac{\rho}{\rho_0} \right)^\gamma.
$$
The adiabatic index \(\gamma\) is 5/3 for a monatomic gas and 7/5 for a cool gas of diatomic molecules like \(H_2\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The speed of propagation is
$$
c_s = \left ( \frac{\gamma P}{\rho} \right)^{1/2} \propto \rho^{(\gamma - 1)/2}.
$$
As long as \(\gamma &amp;gt; 1\), sound will travel faster in a denser gas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sound waves are pressure and density waves. So the crest of the wave, where the density and pressure are highest, travels faster than the trough of the wave. When the crest catches up with the trough, the gradient in density between the two steepens.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In an ocean wave, this leads to the wave breaking. But since a sound wave doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the extra dimension&amp;mdash;at any one position there can only be one density and one pressure. So a sound wave steepens until a shock front forms.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="shock-fronts-on-earth">Shock fronts on earth&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Let the dimensionless amplitude of a sound wave be
$$
\delta \equiv \frac{P_\mathrm{crest} - P_\mathrm{trough}}{P_\mathrm{crest} + P_\mathrm{trough}}
$$
then the distance it will travel before steepening into a shock will be \(d \sim \lambda/\delta\), where \(\lambda\) is the wavelength.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why do we not hear shock waves all the time from ordinary sounds? First, the amplitude of these fall off as the inverse square of distance, so they attenuate quickly. And, even a loud ambulance siren at the distance of 3m has a sound wave of amplitude \(\delta \sim 2 \times 10^{-4}\). But that signal would also need to travel about 2 km before steeping into a shock front.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>High amplitude pressure fluctuations with \(\delta \sim 1\), like those from stun grenades and lightning bolts, will rapidly steepen into shocks.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>We need to obey mass conservation
$$
\frac{d}{dx} (\rho u) = 0
$$
and momentum conservation
$$
\frac{d}{dx}(\rho u^2 + P) = 0
$$
and energy conservation
$$
\frac{d}{dx} \left ( u \rho [u^2/2 + \epsilon] + u P\right) = 0
$$
where \(\epsilon\) is the specific internal energy of the gas, including thermal energy and rotational or vibrational energy of the molecules. In general,
$$
\epsilon = \frac{1}{\gamma - 1} \frac{kT}{m} = \frac{1}{\gamma - 1}\frac{P}{\rho}
$$
where \(m\) is the mass per particle. [Here we&amp;rsquo;re assuming the gas doesn&amp;rsquo;t lose energy by radiating photons, the shock is non-radiative.]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By applying these conservation laws across the shock front, we end up with the &lt;strong>Rankine-Hugoniot&lt;/strong> conditions:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\rho_1 u_1 = \rho_2 u_2
$$
and
$$
\rho_1 u_1^2 + P_1 = \rho_2 u_2^2 + P_2
$$
and
$$
u_1 \rho_1 [u_1^2/2 + \epsilon_1] + u_1 P_1 = u_2 \rho_2 [u_2/2 + \epsilon_2] + u_2 P_2.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>Mach number&lt;/strong> is a dimensionless number that is useful for describing shock fronts
$$
\mathcal{M} \equiv \frac{u_1}{c_1} = \left ( \frac{\rho_1 u_1^2}{\gamma P_1} \right)^{1/2}
$$
where \(c_1\) is the sound speed in the pre-shocked gas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can use the Rankine-Huginoit conditions to solve for the density, pressure, and temperature ratios across the shock front:
$$
\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1} = \frac{u_1}{u_2}
$$
and
$$
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{2 \gamma \mathcal{M}_1^2 - (\gamma - 1)}{\gamma + 1}
$$
and
$$
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{[(\gamma - 1) \mathcal{M}_1^2 + 2][2 \gamma \mathcal{M}_1^2 - (\gamma - 1)]}{(\gamma + 1)^2 \mathcal{M}_1^2}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When post-shock density, pressure, and temperature values are greater than their pre-shock values, that is equivalent to having a Mach number greater than 1. A &lt;strong>strong shock&lt;/strong> is when \(\mathcal{M} \gg 1\). In this regime,
$$
\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1} \approx \frac{\gamma + 1}{\gamma - 1}
$$
and
$$
P_2 \approx \frac{2}{\gamma + 1} \rho_1 u_1^2
$$
and
$$
T_2 \approx \frac{2(\gamma -1 )}{(\gamma + 1)^2} \frac{m}{k} u_1^2.
$$
In the strong-shock regime, the density ratio has a finite value, which depends on the adiabatic index. For a monoatomic gas with \(\gamma = 5/3\), the post-shock gas can be at most four times the density of the pre-shock gas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shocks can produce very high densities and temperatures, though. An interstellar shock front with propagation speed \(u_1 \sim 1000\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\) produces shock-heated gas with
$$
T_2 \approx 1.1 \times 10^7\,\mathrm{K} \left ( \frac{u_1}{1000\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \right)^2.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the frame of the shock, shock-fronts convert supersonic gas into subsonic gas. They increase the density, pressure, and temperature while decreasing the bulk velocity relative to the shock front. Shocks act to generate &lt;em>entropy&lt;/em>, with the increase in specific entropy \(s_2 - s_1 \propto \ln \mathcal{M}_1\) for strong shocks.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="radiating-and-cooling">Radiating and Cooling&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The hot shocked gas is out of equilibrium and starts cooling. So a shock is followed by a &lt;em>radiative zone&lt;/em> where the shock-heated gas is cooling by emitting photons.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3 id="strong-fast-hot-shocks">Strong, fast, hot shocks&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For temperatures \(T &amp;gt; 2 \times 10^7\,\mathrm{K}\), the cooling is dominated by free-free (Bremsstrahlung) emission. Assuming fully ionized hydrogen gas, we get a free-free cooling time of
$$
t_\mathrm{cool} \approx 24\,\mathrm{Myr}\,\left ( \frac{T}{10^7\,\mathrm{K}} \right)^{1/2} \left ( \frac{n_\mathrm{H}}{1\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}} \right)^{-1}
$$
We can recast the post-shock temperature in terms of the shock velocity, and find that in a cooling time, the gas will move a distance
$$
R_\mathrm{cool} \sim u_2 t_\mathrm{cool} \sim \frac{u_1}{4} t_\mathrm{cool} \sim 6\,\mathrm{kpc} \left( \frac{u_1}{1000\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \right)^2 \left ( \frac{n_\mathrm{H}}{1\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}} \right)^{-1}
$$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the approximate thickness of the radiative zone for a strong shock with high temperatures. This is a long distance, especially compared to the scale height of interstellar gas in our galaxy. So, the hot gas produced by high-speed shocks &lt;em>doesn&amp;rsquo;t have enough time to cool&lt;/em> before the shock runs out of gas to shock.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="slower-cooler-shocks">Slower, cooler shocks&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>At slightly lower temperatures, \(10^5\,\mathrm{K} &amp;lt; T &amp;lt; 2\times10^7\,\mathrm{K}\), which correspond to shock speeds of \(90\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1} &amp;lt; u_1 &amp;lt; 1300\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\), collisionally-excited line emission does the cooling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This results in a cooling time of
$$
t_\mathrm{cool} \approx 0.10 \,\mathrm{Myr}\, \left(\frac{u_1}{300\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \right)^{3.46} \left ( \frac{n_\mathrm{H}}{1\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}} \right)^{-1}.
$$
And we can calculate the thickness of the radiative zone as
$$
R_\mathrm{cool} \sim \frac{u_1}{4} t_\mathrm{cool} \sim 8\,\mathrm{pc} \left ( \frac{u_1}{300\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}} \right)^{4.46} \left( \frac{n_\mathrm{H}}{1\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}} \right)^{-1}
$$.
These shorter time and length scales mean that radiative cooling is more effective at changing the structure of slower shocks.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="isothermal-shocks">Isothermal shocks&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Often, it&amp;rsquo;s the case that the thermal equilibrium temperature \(T_3\) that the gas reaches after passing through the radiative zone is nearly equal to the initial temperature \(T_1\). This is called an &lt;strong>isothermal shock&lt;/strong>, and we can re-solve the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions to find that the increase in density is
$$
\frac{\rho_3}{\rho_1} = \left ( \frac{u_1}{c_1} \right)^2 = \mathcal{M}_T^2
$$
where \(\mathcal{M}_T\) is the isothermal Mach number of the shock. So, radiative shocks can reach arbitrarily high compression as their Mach number approaches infinity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Molecular Clouds, Observations, Chemistry, and Ionization</title><link>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/26-molecular-clouds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/26-molecular-clouds/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://psu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/Astro+542A+Nov+8/1_s6az9bt5">Zoom link&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="taxonomy-and-astronomy">Taxonomy and Astronomy&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First, let&amp;rsquo;s try to bring some order to the various scales and densities at which molecular hydrogen can be found in our Galaxy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In general, individual clouds are separated into categories based upon their &lt;em>optical&lt;/em> appearance: diffuse, translucent, or dark, depending on the magnitudes of visual extinction \(A_V\) through the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Diffuse molecular cloud&lt;/strong>: \(A_V &amp;lt; 1 \) mag&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Translucent molecular cloud&lt;/strong>: \(1 &amp;lt; A_V &amp;lt; 5 \) mag&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Dark cloud&lt;/strong>: \(5 &amp;lt; A_V &amp;lt; 20 \) mag&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Infrared Dark cloud&lt;/strong>: 20 up to \(&amp;gt; 100 \) mag&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Diffuse&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>translucent&lt;/strong> clouds have sufficient UV radiation to keep gas-phase carbon photoionized throughout the cloud. These types of clouds are usually pressure-confined.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The typical &lt;strong>dark cloud&lt;/strong> is self-gravitating, and some contain regions with \(A_V\) up to 20 mag.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are some examples of dark clouds that are opaque to background PAHs even at 8 microns wavelengths, (indicating \(A_V &amp;gt; 100\) mag) these are called &lt;strong>infrared dark clouds&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These terms describe the surface density of the cloud in terms of visual extinction. But, molecular clouds are not a one-parameter family, and there are other terms to describe cloud properties (not always uniformly employed)!&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We can distinguish a &lt;strong>giant molecular cloud (GMC)&lt;/strong> from a &lt;strong>dark cloud&lt;/strong> based on total mass.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Groups of distinct clouds are called &lt;strong>cloud complexes&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Structures within a cloud (self-gravitating) are called &lt;strong>clumps&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Clumps may or may not be forming stars. If they are, they are called &lt;strong>star-forming clumps&lt;/strong>.
&lt;strong>Cores&lt;/strong> are density peaks within star-forming clumps that will form a &lt;em>single star&lt;/em> (or a binary star).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Molecular clouds are sometimes found in isolation, but in most cases they are grouped together into &lt;strong>complexes&lt;/strong>. Large complexes hav substructure, though, so the distinction between &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;cloud complex&amp;rdquo; is somewhat arbitrary. Observers use intensities, radial velocities, and thermal emission from dust to delineate boundaries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Draine Table 32.3 has a nice summary of the terminology used for cloud complexes and their components.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most molecular mass is found in large clouds known as &amp;ldquo;giant molecular clouds&amp;rdquo; or GMCs, which have masses ranging from \(10^3\,M_\odot\) to \(\sim 2 \times 10^5\,M_\odot\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A &lt;strong>GMC complex&lt;/strong> is a gravitationally-bound group of GMCs (as well as smaller clouds) with total mass \(&amp;gt; 10^{5.3}\,M_\odot\). The nearest GMC complex is the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC) complex. Here is a map of the structure&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Molecular clouds were originally discovered by star counts. First, Herschel noticed in 1785 that there were patches along the Milky Way where very few stars were seen, but he incorrectly attributed this to an actual underdensity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, we know that this is from the obscuration by dusty clouds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Modern studies including J, H, K to optical surveys can now provide a very good map of dusty. In fact, coupling stellar measurements with spectral models, and in some cases distances, allows us to make a 3D map of the dust distribution in our Galaxy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="molecular-radio-lines">Molecular radio lines&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Most common way to study molecular gas is through the \(J = 1 \rightarrow 0\) transition of carbon monoxide. The CO luminosity of a cloud is approximately proportional to the total mass of the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, using velocity information + assumed Galactic rotation curve (and conversion from CO to molecular Hydrogen) allows us to infer the surface density of molecular hydrogen over the Milky Way disk.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Gravity: velocity dispersion is proportional to cloud mass&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Density: cloud size is inversely proportional to density&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>For larger clouds, turbulent velocities exceed local sound speed, meaning that the turbulent motions are supersonic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The density peaks within a molecular cloud are self-gravitating. If we consider only the kinetic energy associated with fluid motions (neglect magnetic fields and pressure), we can estimate the clump mass using the virial theorem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With modern data, laws still hold up reasonably well.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Shocked gas would quickly cool and then radiate away kinetic energy, and the clouds would collapse quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So what is the source of additional energy that is injected into the turbulent motions? Outflows from protostars could be one possibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another is that the time scale for shock waves to damp is longer than expected (but not backed up by simulations).&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="molecular-clouds-chemistry-and-ionization">Molecular Clouds: Chemistry and Ionization&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In the Milky Way, about 22% of interstellar gas is in molecular clouds, and most of the hydrogen there is in the form of \(H_2\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cosmic Rays guarantee that there are always &lt;em>some&lt;/em> ions present in the gas, and in the outer layers of molecular clouds there may be enough UV radiation to photoionize metal species.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s walk through the various types of reactions that can be important&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>photoionization&lt;/strong>:
$$
AB + h \nu \rightarrow AB^+ + e^-
$$
Many molecules can be photoionized w/ photons with \(h \nu &amp;lt; 13.6\) eV (but not \(H_2\), which has an ionization potential of 15.43). Thus, molecular hydrogen will not be photoionized even in H I regions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>photodissociation&lt;/strong>:
$$
AB + h \nu \rightarrow AB^* \rightarrow A + B
$$
For species like \(H_2\) and CO, photoexcitation leading to dissociation occurs via &lt;em>lines&lt;/em> rather than continuum. This key fact allows these species to self-shield, or be partially shielded (like CO) if there is accidental overlap between important absorption lines with strong lines of \(H_2\).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Neutral-neutral exchange reactions
$$
AB + C \rightarrow AC + B
$$
In a molecular cloud, most species are neutral, and so neutral-neutral collisions are frequent. Frequently, there will be an energy barrier that must be overcome for a reaction to proceed, i.e., the ABC complex must pass through an intermediate stat that has higher energy level than the initial AB + C, even for exothermic reactions. Interestingly, this isn&amp;rsquo;t the case for CO formation, which has a negligible energy barrier and can form at the low temperatures of molecular clouds
$$
C + OH \rightarrow CO + H
$$&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ion-neutral exchange reactions
$$
AB^+ + C \rightarrow AC^+ + B
$$
Exothermic reactions of this type generally lack energy barriers, so the reaction can proceed even at low temperatures. And, the induced dipole interaction boosts the rate somewhat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Radiative association reactions (as we discussed in the context of molecular hydrogen). Basically, the excited complex needs to emit a photon before the complex flies apart on the timescale of a single vibrational period.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>In this lecture, we&amp;rsquo;re going to take a deep dive into molecular hydrogen, which will set us up for the next lecture on molecular clouds, observation, chemistry, and ionization.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="formation-mechanisms">Formation Mechanisms&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="direct">Direct&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Why does molecular hydrogen exist in the ISM at all? The direct formation
$$
H + H \rightarrow H_2 + h \nu
$$
has such a small rate coefficient that the reaction can be ignored completely in ISM chemistry. The three-body reaction
$$
3H \rightarrow H_2 + H + KE
$$
can occur, but the rate is also negligible at interstellar or intergalactic densities. (This is possible at the densities of a protostar or protoplanetary disk, however).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The process by which two hydrogen atoms bond in the ISM is called &lt;strong>direct radiative association&lt;/strong>
$$
H + H \rightarrow H_2^* \rightarrow H_2 + h \nu.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two hydrogen atoms meet to create an excited hydrogen molecule \(H_2^*\) that is unbound; it needs to emit a photon with enough energy to leave it in a bound state, otherwise it will break apart.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The lifetime of the excited hydrogen molecule (until it breaks apart) is exceptionally short, approximately one vibration period \(\sim 2 \pi / \omega_0 \sim 10^{-14}\) s.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because the hydrogen molecule has no electric dipole moment, the probability that it will emit a photon is small. One possibility is via rotational quadrupole transitions, which have \(A_{ul} \sim 10^{-11}\) s. So to form a hydrogen molecule via this, you multiple the probability to emit during the lifetime of the excited hydrogen molecule, and get a probability of
$$
p \sim A_{ul} (2 \pi / \omega_0) \sim 10^{-25}
$$
of emitting a photon before it falls apart. This leads to a miniscule rate coefficient \(k_\mathrm{dra} 10^{-23}\;\mathrm{cm}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}\), and therefore at densities typical of the interstellar medium.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="pure-gas-not-that-fast">Pure gas (not that fast)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Terminology:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>recombination&lt;/strong>: when a free electron binds to a positive ion&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>attachment&lt;/strong>: when a free electron binds to a neutral atom or negative ion&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>ionization&lt;/strong>: when an electron is stripped from a neutral atom or positive ion&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>detachment&lt;/strong>: when an electron is stripped from a negative ion&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In pure gas, \(H_2\) is made via a two-step process:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Produce negative hydrogen ions by radiative attachment&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>$$
H^0 + e^- \rightarrow H^- + h \nu
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a slow process (not as slow as direct radiative association, though), with rate coefficient \(k_\mathrm{ra} \approx 10^{-16}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The next step (is more rapid) is the production of molecular hydrogen by associative detachment
$$
H^- + H^0 \rightarrow H_2 + e^-
$$
this step has a rate coefficient of \(k_\mathrm{ad} \approx 10^{-9}\,\mathrm{cm}^3\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This two-step process is hindered by the fact that the intermediate product \(H^-\) is a very fragile ion, it only takes 0.77 eV to detach one of the electrons. In most of interstellar space, the photodetachment rate of \(H^-\) is
$$
\zeta_\mathrm{det} \approx 10^{-7}\; \mathrm{s}^{-1} \approx 8.5 \;\mathrm{yr}^{-1}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, associative detachment (and the resulting production of hydrogen molecules) will dominate over photodetachment when
$$
n_\mathrm{H\,I} &amp;gt; \frac{\zeta_\mathrm{det}}{k_\mathrm{ad}} \approx 70\,\mathrm{cm}^3
$$
That&amp;rsquo;s pretty dense, so in most of the ISM, an \(H^-\) ion will undergo photodetachment before it has the opportunity to make an \(H_2\) molecule.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without any dust, though, this is dominant channel of molecular hydrogen formation (such as in the early universe).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="grain-assisted-grain-catalysis">Grain assisted (grain catalysis)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Whenever dust grains are present, they form the dominant mechanism for making molecular hydrogen, called grain catalysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Compared to low-density interstellar gas, the surface of a dust grain is a frenzied lab of chemical activity. Let&amp;rsquo;s unpack why.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Terminology&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>adsorption&lt;/strong>: atoms sticking to the surface of a grain&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>desoprtion&lt;/strong>: atoms (or molecules) escaping from the surface of a grain&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When a hydrogen atom collides with a grain, there is some probability that it will stick, with the modulation that&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>slower atoms are more likely to stick&lt;/li>
&lt;li>hot grains are less sticky&lt;/li>
&lt;li>smaller grains are less sticky&lt;/li>
&lt;li>some dependence on composition&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For typical molecular cloud conditions, the probability of sticking (adsorption) is about 30% for a 0.1 micron grain. That&amp;rsquo;s pretty high!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once the hydrogen atom is stuck to the surface of the grain, it&amp;rsquo;s held there by the relatively weak van der Waals force. The binding energy is large enough such that the atom doesn&amp;rsquo;t immediately evaporate from the grain&amp;rsquo;s surface, however, it&amp;rsquo;s also small enough such that the atom can skitter its way across the grain surface in a thermally driven random walk. This is called surface diffusion.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="Fig7-4.jpg"
alt="Atoms adsorb onto the surface of a grain, diffuse until they meet another atom, and sometimes form a molecule. Credit: Ryden and Pogge Figure 7.4, following Dulieu et al. 2013"/>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>If, during the random walk, the atom encounters another H atom, they can bond to form a hydrogen molecule. The energy released by this reaction will allow the new molecule to escape from the surface (desorption).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To calculate the formation rate, we need to define a grain cross section, assume some grain size distribution, and average over the velocity distribution of hydrogen atoms (thermalized), and then incorporate a probability that it sticks to the dust grain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Carrying out these calculations using state of the art assumptions leads to the conclusion that dust grains are converting atomic hydrogen into molecular hydrogen on a &lt;em>characteristic timescale of 13 Myr&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="destroying-molecular-hydrogen">Destroying Molecular Hydrogen&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Photodissociation is the main way by which molecular hydrogen is destroyed. Because we are dealing with a hydrogen molecule, though, the path is a bit more complicated than you would otherwise expect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, let&amp;rsquo;s look at the potential of the molecule.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="Fig7-1.jpg"
alt="We can look at the potential of the \(\mathrm{H}_2\) molecule as a function of \(r\), the distance between the two protons. The bound vibrational energy levels \(v = 0 \rightarrow 13\) are depicted as horizontal lines. Credit: Ryden and Pogge Fig 7.1, Data from Sharp 1971"/>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In theory, we could just hit a hydrogen molecule with a photon with energy \(h \nu &amp;gt; 4.5 \)eV, lifting it to an unbound potential energy. The problem is that this transition is an electric quadrupole transition, which has a small transition probability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The main process by which molecular hydrogen is dissociated is a two-step process. Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the potential energy curve for the ground electronic state of molecular hydrogen, as well as for the first and second excited electronic states.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="Fig7-5.jpg"
alt="Schematic diagram of the potential energy curves for the ground electronic states and the first and second excited electronic states of molecular hydrogen. Credit: Ryden and Pogge 7.5, data from Sharp 1971."/>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Difference between ground state, \(v = 0, J=0\) and first electronic excited state \(v = 0, J=0\) is 11.18 eV, slightly higher than the 10.2 eV Lyman alpha line. This is a permitted transition with a large transition probability.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once in the first excited state, the transitions between various vibrational and rotational in this state and the various vibrational and rotational states in the electronic ground state are called &lt;em>Lyman band&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The transitions between the second electronic state and ground electronic state are called &lt;em>Werner band&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Both Lyman and Werner band bands lie in energy range 11.18 to 13.60 eV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once in the first electronic state, it can transition back down to the ground electronic state. But, about 12% of the time, it can also transition to a vibrational state with \(v &amp;gt; 14\), which is unbound, the hydrogen atoms fly apart and dissociation is complete.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>The first step, radiative excitation of \(\mathrm{H}_2\) to an excited electronic state, requires a photon with energy in the wavelength range 912 to 1108 angstroms. In the solar neighborhood, these photons are produced by hot stars.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Because of the Lyman and Werner levels, the cross section for a hydrogen molecule is a complicated function of energy. But, using the energy density of the solar neighborhood and incorporating the dissociation fraction, the rate of dissociation is
$$
\zeta_\mathrm{dis} \approx 4.2 \times 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So the typical timescale for photodissociation of molecular hydrogen is \(1/\zeta_\mathrm{dis}\), or about \(10^3\) yr, about 4 orders of magnitude quicker than the \(10^7\) yr timescale for creation of molecular hydrogen by grain surface catalysis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The equilibrium abundance of molecular hydrogen is determined by a balance between the &lt;em>slow&lt;/em> creation of \(\mathrm{H}_2\) on the surface of grains and the &lt;em>quick&lt;/em> destruction of molecular hydrogen by UV photons from stars. If you work out the equilibrium densities and assume that the UV radiation field inside molecular clouds were the same as outside of it, you find that molecular hydrogen should be pretty rare, only dominating over atomic hydrogen when the density was greater than&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
n_\mathrm{H} \sim 10^6\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, observations tell us that molecular hydrogen formation dominates over atomic hydrogen at densities as low as \(n_\mathrm{H} \sim 300\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\). Why?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is because of &lt;strong>self-shielding&lt;/strong>, whereby UV photons in the range \(h \nu = 11.18 \rightarrow 13.60\) eV are absorbed by hydrogen molecules in the outer layer of the cloud, preventing them from reaching hydrogen molecules in the cloud center.
(Remember, these &amp;ldquo;shield&amp;rdquo; hydrogen molecules aren&amp;rsquo;t immediately dissociated&amp;hellip; the dissociation only occurs some fraction of the time when the decay reaction is down to a \(v &amp;gt; 14\) state, which is unbound).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Self-shielding becomes important when you have molecular hydrogen column density greater than \(10^{14}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\). The interiors of molecular clouds are mostly saved from photodissociation by a self-sacrificing layer of gas about 0.1 parsec thick, and with density \(n_\mathrm{H} \sim 300\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Things change, though, when newly formed stars are of spectral types O, B, or A and are hot enough to pour out photons with energies \(h \nu &amp;gt; 11.18\) eV, which form photodissociation regions around the hot stars.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="photodissociation-regions">Photodissociation regions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Have an obvious parallel to H II regions, and in fact you can have a complicated structure of ionized, neutral atoms, and molecular hydrogen.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>60% of gas in Milky Way is in H I regions (predominantly atomic H).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gas can be surveyed by 21-cm line (emission and absorption), absorption lines in spectra of stars, and infrared emission from dust mixed w/ hydrogen&lt;/li>
&lt;li>magnetic field in gas visualized through starlight polarized by aligned dust grains and in some cases Zeeman effect&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="h-i-21-cm-line-observations">H I 21-cm line observations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We covered a lot of this material when talking about excitation and atomic levels, but the following is a more observational picture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the important pieces we derived from that lecture is that &lt;em>as long as 21-cm is optically thin&lt;/em>, a measurement of the emission is a &lt;em>direct&lt;/em> measure of the total column density of H I.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also saw how if we have a background quasar, we could determine the spin temperature, which is normally close to the kinetic temperature of the gas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s look at the following figure&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Surveys like these support the idea that (in the solar neighborhood), interstellar H I is found primarily in two distinct phases: cold neutral medium (cold absorbing gas) and warm neutral medium (warm gas seen only in emission).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="distribution-of-the-h-i">Distribution of the H I&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Differential rotation of gas in the Galactic disk means that regions of the Galaxy at different distances from the Sun will have different radial velocities. Therefore the 21 cm intensity vs. radial velocity chart can be used to map out distribution of H I in our Galaxy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="zeeman-effect">Zeeman effect&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For the weak (5 microGauss) fields in the diffuse ISM, the Zeeman effect results in a small frequency shift between the left and right circularly polarized 21-cm emission. Observations are in general difficult.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="infrared-emission">Infrared emission&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Dust is a tracer of the ISM because H I gas is dusty. In the dust chapter, we talked about the correlation between 100 micron emission and H I column density, as measured from 21-cm observations.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The good correlation tells us that&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>dust and gas are well-mixed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>starlight heating the dust must be fairly uniform&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="heating-and-cooling-in-h-i-clouds">Heating and cooling in H I clouds&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Most of the interstellar gas in the Milky Way is neutral, and 78% of the neutral hydrogen is atomic (not molecular).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s examine the heating and cooling processes of H I so that we can estimate what temperatures we&amp;rsquo;d expect it to be at. We will find that, under some circumstances, the ISM can be thought of as two distinct phases in pressure equilibrium.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="heating">Heating&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Heating mechanisms include&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>ionization by CRs&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Photoionization of H and He by x-rays&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Photoionization of dust grains by starlight UV&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Photoionization of metals like C, Mg, Si, Fe, etc. by starlight UV&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Heating by shock waves and other MHD phenomena&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="photoelectric-heating-by-dust">Photoelectric heating by dust&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Photoelectrons emitted by dust grains dominate the heating of diffuse H I in the Milky Way. Large neutral carbonaceous grains can in principle be photoionized by photons with energies down to 4.5 eV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Small grains account for most of the UV absorption and photoelectric yields are enhanced for small grains, so therefore the photoelectric heating rate is dominated by photoelectrons from very small grains, including the PAHs.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cooling-via-c-ii-158-microns-o-i-63-microns-and-other-lines">Cooling via [C II] 158 microns, [O I] 63 microns, and other lines&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For temperatures above 10^4 K, the cooling is dominated by two fine structure lines [C II] 158 microns, [O I] 63 microns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The critical densities for these lines are high, implying that collisional deexcitation is unimportant in the diffuse ISM of the Milky way.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="two-phases-for-h-i-in-the-ism">Two phases for H I in the ISM&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now let&amp;rsquo;s investigate what thermal equilibrium looks like in an H I region. As before, we require a balance between heating and cooling
$$
\Gamma(T_\mathrm{eq}) = \Lambda(T_\mathrm{eq}).
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, let&amp;rsquo;s examine how the steady state temperature \(T_\mathrm{eq}\) varies as a function of density \(n_H\).&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="fig_30_2a.jpg"
alt="The steady state temperature as a function of density, for gas heated by cosmic rays and photoelectric heating by dust grains. Two lines of constant \(n_H T\) are shown. Credit: Draine Fig 30.2a"/>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>As we see, the equilibrium temperature is a monotonically decreasing function of \(n_H \). This is because of the line-cooling mechanisms, which are throttled by how quickly atoms can be collisionally excited (to be line-radiated away).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, let&amp;rsquo;s examine the solution for equilibrium temperature when we fix the &lt;em>pressure&lt;/em>
$$
p = n k T.
$$
Fixing the pressure is saying that things are in &lt;em>dynamic equilibrium&lt;/em>, because if there was a pressure imbalance, then things would move to equalize pressure (the way wind blows from a high pressure system to a low pressure system on earth).&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We see that at &lt;em>low pressures&lt;/em> the heating balances cooling at 6000 K (which correspond to WNM conditions).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We see that at &lt;em>high pressure&lt;/em> the heating balances cooling at 100 K (corresponding to CNM conditions).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When you combine a heating gain \(\Gamma\) that is independent of gas temperature with a cooling function \(\Lambda(T)\) that is not a simple power law, you get multiple phases of the ISM in pressure equilibrium with each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="fig_30_2b.jpg"
alt="The steady state temperature as a function of thermal pressure \(p\). For pressures in the range between the two dotted lines, there are three possible equilibria temperatures: a high temperature WNM solution, a low temperature CNM solution, and an intermediate temperature equilibrium that is unstable.

Credit: Draine Fig 30.2b&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>At intermediate pressures, for a given pressure, there are three possible solutions for equilibrium temperature. The upper and lower solutions are stable (if perturbed away from equilibrium temperature, it will return to it). But the intermediate solution is unstable:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>if perturbed upward, it will warm to the stable WNM setup&lt;/li>
&lt;li>if perturbed downward, it will cool to the stable CNM setup&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So, given our best estimates of cosmic ray ionization, photoelectric heating, and cooling processes in the diffuse ISM, we conclude that an ISM in thermal equilibrium and dynamic equilibrium (equal pressure) would have two distinct phases, provided the pressure is in between the two vertical lines (otherwise would just have one phase).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is called the &amp;ldquo;two-phase&amp;rdquo; ISM model, and was first developed by George Field in 1969. Later revisited a number of times with differing assumptions about grain photoelectric heating, grain-assisted recombination, inelastic collisional cross-sections for cooling processes, and coolant abundances. So, the &amp;ldquo;two-phase&amp;rdquo; model has a long and storied history in ISM study. McKee and Ostriker 1977 expanded this to the &amp;ldquo;three-phase&amp;rdquo; ISM, with the hot ionized medium, where bremsstrahlung is the chief cooling process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Observationally, the different phases will have different emission spectra.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, the dust emission at 100 microns will be the same for both phases, since the dust is heated by the same radiation field. But, the line emission will vary considerably. For the CNM, the strongest coolant is [C II] 150 microns. For the WMN, the strongest coolant is [O I] 63.2 microns.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Heating and Cooling of HII regions</title><link>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/23-hii-heating-cooling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/23-hii-heating-cooling/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://psu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/Astro+542A+Lecture+Oct+27/1_rgnhel5n">Zoom link&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now that we&amp;rsquo;ve taken some time to introduce and discuss dust, we&amp;rsquo;ll return to H II regions and discuss heating and cooling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>H II regions are regions of photoionized gas around hot stars. Thus far, we&amp;rsquo;ve just asserted that the temperatures of these regions were around \(10^4\) K, and introduced nebular diagnostics to allow us to measure those temperatures. In today&amp;rsquo;s lecture, we&amp;rsquo;ll be discussing the heating and cooling mechanisms that regulate the temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The dominant heating mechanism is photoionization. Photoionizing photons have energies larger that the ionization energy, the resulting photoelectron will have nonzero kinetic energy and add to the thermal energy of the gas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recombination processes, primarily radiative recombination, are removing electrons from the plasma (along with the kinetic energy they had). Thermal energy is also lost when an electron collisionally excites ions from lower to higher energy levels (followed by the emission of photons).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The balance of these processes sets the temperature of the gas.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="heating-by-photoionization">Heating by photoionization&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Photoelectric absorption creates a photoelectron with some kinetic energy
$$
X^{+r} + h \nu \rightarrow X^{+r+1} + e^- + KE
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let \(\sigma_{pe}(\nu)\) be the photoionization cross section for \(X^{+r}\) in its ground electronic state. Given some radiation field \(u_\nu\), how can we calculate the probability per unit time for photoionization? i.e., units of 1/s?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s walk through how we set up an integral, using the cross section, the speed (c), and the energy density
$$
\zeta(X^{+r}) = \int_{\nu_0}^\infty \sigma_\mathrm{pe}(\nu) c \left [ \frac{u_\nu}{h \nu}\right] d \nu.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How much kinetic energy is injected into the gas? Well, \(h \nu_0\) is the threshold energy for photoionization from the ground state. Therefore, if a photon with \(h \nu\) does the photoionization, then \(h \nu - h \nu_0\) is injected into the plasma. We can calculate the &lt;strong>heating rate&lt;/strong> (ergs/cm^3) by calculating the kinetic energy released per volume per photoionization event as
$$
\Gamma_\mathrm{pe} = n(X^{+r}) \int_{\nu_0}^\infty \sigma_\mathrm{pe}(\nu) c \left [ \frac{u_\nu}{h \nu}\right] (h \nu - h \nu_0) d \nu.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The mean energy of each photoelectron is
$$
E_\mathrm{pe}(X^{+r}) = \frac{\Gamma_\mathrm{pe}}{n(X^{+r}) \zeta(X^{+r})}
$$
which depends on the spectrum of photons responsible for photoionization. If we assume that the star&amp;rsquo;s radiation field can be approximated as blackbody with some color temperature \(T_c\), then we can define the dimensionless ratio
$$
\varphi \equiv \frac{E_\mathrm{pe}}{k T_c}
$$
For different temperature stars, there will correction factors for photoelectron energy weighted by the blackbody spectrum \(\varphi_0 k T_c\) and the average photoelectron energy \(\langle \varphi \rangle k T_c\), but they are order unity across a wide range of stellar temperatures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The heating rate depends on the abundance of the species that is being ionized. If the H II region is in photoionization equilibrium, then
$$
\zeta(X^{+r}) n(X^{+r}) = \alpha n_e n(X^{+r+1}).
$$
If you recall, \(\alpha\) is the rate coefficient for recombination. This can be used to obtain the local heating rate
$$
\Gamma_{pe} = \alpha n_e n(X^{+r + 1}) \varphi k T_c.
$$
The rate per unit volume of injection of photoelectron energy rate is equal to the recombination rate per unit volumen times the mean photoelectron energy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In an H II region, the dominant element H will be nearly fully ionized, so \(n(H^+)\approx n_H\), and the rate due to photoionization of H is
$$
\Gamma_\mathrm{pe}( H \rightarrow H^+) \approx \alpha_B n_H n_e \varphi k T_c.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="other-heating-processes">Other heating processes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Here are a few other heating processes that can contribute.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Photoelectric emission from dust: dust grains absorb photons, then produce energetic photoelectrons. This effect is important when the radiation field has lots of photons between 10 and 13.6 eV&amp;hellip; too weak to ionize H, but able to ionize a dust grain AND there is enough dust present to absorb photons.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cosmic Rays: interaction w/ bound electrons (ejecting energetic secondary electron) and transfer of KE to free electrons by elastic scattering, \(\Gamma_\mathrm{CR}\).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In normal H II regions, heating of the gas is dominated by photoionization of H and He, so we usually just refer to \(\Gamma \approx \Gamma_\mathrm{pe}\). The photoionization heating is dependent on the electron density, the ion density, nd the temperature (UV intensity) of star doing the ionizing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cooling-processes">Cooling processes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Consider the balance between heating and cooling processes when the plasma is in ionization equilibrium&amp;mdash;every ionization event is balanced by a recombination event.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>total cooling rate&lt;/strong> is denoted by \(\Lambda\) and has units of (ergs/cm^3). We&amp;rsquo;ll examine some of the sub-contributions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="recombination-radiation">Recombination radiation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Every time an electron recombines with an ion, the plasma loses the kinetic energy of the recombining electron. The rate per unit volume at which thermal energy is lost is
$$
\Lambda_\mathrm{rr} = \alpha_B n_e n(H^+) \langle E_\mathrm{rr} \rangle
$$
where \(\langle E_\mathrm{rr} \rangle\) is the mean KE of the recombining electrons.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="free-free-emission">Free-Free Emission&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Free electrons scattering off of free ions produce free-free emission. If we&amp;rsquo;re in a pure H plasma at 10^4 K, then the free-free emission per recombining electron is
$$
\frac{\Lambda_\mathrm{ff}}{n_e n(H^+) \alpha_B} = 0.54 T_4^{0.37} k T.
$$
Where \(\Lambda_\mathrm{ff} \) is the power per unit volume given by (Ch 10.12). For T of 10^4, then radiative recombination and free-free emission together cause the plasma to lose about \(\sim k T\) of kinetic energy per Case-B recombination.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="collisionally-excited-line-radiation">Collisionally-Excited Line Radiation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In an H II region, most H will be ionized.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If there is He or He^+, the energy of the first excited state is quite far above the ground state, so it&amp;rsquo;s rare that it will be collisionally excited for any relevant thermal plasma.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But if there are heavier metals, like oxygen, then there may be ions like O I, O II, or O III that have energy levels that can be collisionally excited by electrons with kinetic energies of just a few eV (as we studied in the nebular diagnostics lecture). And then they will radiate via lines, and cool the gas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(If the collisional excitation is immediately followed by a collisional deexcitation, then the kinetic energy of the gas is unchanged.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some of the principal collisionally excited cooling lines in H II regions are N II, O II, O III, Ne II, S II and S III.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="thermal-equilibrium">Thermal equilibrium&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The gas will stabalize at a temperature where heating rate balances the total cooling rate
$$
\Gamma(T) = \Lambda(T).
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When you investigate each of these processes in detail for an average H II region, you get a steady-state temperature of 8,000 K.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you fiddle with the metallicities, and thus the abundance of cooling species, the steady state temperature changes. In a low metallicity galaxy, for example, the equilibrium temperature rises to 15,000 K. But if you raise the heavy element abundances by a factor of three, such as in the central region of a mature spiral galaxy, then the H II region temperature is 5,000 K.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>Draine Ch. 24, 25, 26&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve defined temperature as an &amp;ldquo;internal energy.&amp;rdquo; For an ensemble of particles, this translated into a statement about their velocity distributions (Maxwellian). For a dust grain, a temperature is a measure of the internal energy present in its vibrational modes and low-lying electronic excitations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If a dust grain has an internal energy \(E\), then we can define the temperature as that such that for the grain
$$
\langle E_\mathrm{int} \rangle_T = E
$$
bascially, the temperature defines the average internal energy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the internal energy is very small (similar to the level of the first excited state), the idea of temperature becomes difficult to grapple with. But, most grains will have temperatures larger than this, and we can use temperature as a reasonable concept.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can add or remove energy to a grain through absorption and emission of photons, or by inelastic collisions with atoms and molecules from the gas. (Grain-grain collisions can do this, but they are rare).&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In a diffuse region, grain heating is dominated by absorption of starlight photons.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a dark region, grain heating is dominated by inelastic collisions.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The dust grains responsible for the bulk of observed extinction at optical wavelengths are grains with radii \(a &amp;gt; 0.03\,\mu m\) and are considered &amp;ldquo;classical&amp;rdquo; macroscopic grains. Absorption/emission of a single quantum photon does not appreciably change the total energy in vibrational or electronic excitations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are also ultrasmall particles (down to large molecules) where quantum effects are important.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="radiative-heating">Radiative heating&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After an optical or UV photon is absorbed by a grain, an electron is raised into an excited electronic state. Sometimes the grain will luminesce, where the excited state decays radiatively and emits a photon equal to or less than the absorbed photon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, more likely, the electronically excited state will deexcite nonradiatively, such that the energy goes into many vibrational modes as heat. We can calculate the rate of grain heating from absorption of radiation as&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\frac{d E}{d t} = \int \frac{u_\nu d \nu}{h \nu} \times c \times h \nu \times Q_\mathrm{abs}(\nu) \pi a^2
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i.e., the number density of photons in that frequency bin, photons moving at the speed of light with energy \(h \nu\), and the grain&amp;rsquo;s absorption cross section.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;h2 id="radiative-cooling">Radiative cooling&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Grains loose energy by infrared cooling, at a rate
$$
\frac{d E}{d t} = \int d \nu 4 \pi B_\nu(T_d) C_\mathrm{abs}(\nu) = 4 \pi a^2 \langle Q_\mathrm{abs} \rangle_{T_d} \sigma T_d^4
$$
where \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and \(\langle Q_\mathrm{abs} \rangle\) is the emission efficiency averaged over some spectrum. We&amp;rsquo;ll use \(T_d\) for the Plank function of the dust temperature, and \(\star\) for the spectrum of radiation heating the grain.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="steady-state-grain-temperature">Steady-state grain temperature&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The steady state temperature \(T_{ss}\) can be calculated by the balance of cooling and heating
$$
4 \pi a^2 \langle Q_\mathrm{abs} \rangle_{T_{ss}} \sigma T^4_{ss} = \pi a^2 \langle Q_\mathrm{abs} \rangle_\star u_\star c
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a typical interstellar radiation field, and the absorption and emission properties of silicate and graphite, you get steady-state grain temperatures of about 15 - 20 Kelvin.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ultrasmall-dust-grains">Ultrasmall dust grains&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If the grain is very small, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really make sense to define a temperature, since each photon absorption event dramatically spikes what we would otherwise define as temperature. Instead, we need to consider a probability distribution function of temperatures. But, small grains can reach high &amp;ldquo;temperatures&amp;rdquo; above 100 K, where they will radiate strongly in the PAH features at 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 microns.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="infrared-emission-from-grains">Infrared emission from grains&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In a typical spiral galaxy, about 1/3 of the energy radiated by stars is absorbed by dust grains and then reemitted in the infrared. Though infrared emission is a quantum process, you can approximate it as a &amp;ldquo;thermal&amp;rdquo; approach,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
j_\nu = \sum_i \int d a \frac{d n_i}{d a} \int d T \left (\frac{d P}{d T} \right)&lt;em>{i,a} C&lt;/em>\mathrm{abs} (\nu, i, a) B_\nu(T)
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>where you&amp;rsquo;re summing over the different types of grains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To calculate \(j_\nu\), you need&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>a grain model to provide the grain size distribution for each composition&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the absorption cross sections&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the temperature distribution functions (for large grains, the temperature distribution function is so narrow that you can approximate it via a delta function located at \(T_{ss}\))&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="grain-physics-charging-and-sputtering">Grain Physics: Charging and Sputtering&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Grains can be given some charge by collisions. If the grain is neutral, an approaching electron on ion will polarize the grain, attracting the projectile to the grain. This can improve the charging rate for very small grains.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="photoelectric-emission">Photoelectric emission&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When an energetic photon is absorbed by the grain, excites an electron to a sufficiently high energy such that the electron escapes from the grain. When an electron is ejected this way, it&amp;rsquo;s called a &amp;ldquo;photo electron.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The photoelectron yield \(Y_\mathrm{pe}(h \nu, a , U)\) is the probability that a photon of energy \(h \nu\) will result in a photoelectron. It appears that UV radiation in average starlight background is able to drive grains with radii \(a &amp;gt; 0.01 \mu m\) to positive potentials.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sputtering">Sputtering&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If the gas temperature is sufficiently high, then impinging atoms or ions will erode the grain, one atom at a time. This process is called sputtering. It also happens on the surfaces of moons in our solar system. In the ISM, sputtering rates can dictate grain lifetimes, for \(10^5\) yrs near a supernova remnant. In a galaxy cluster, \(10^7\) yr, which is short compared to the cluster age.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="grain-dynamics">Grain dynamics&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll cover the list of forces and torques that act upon grains. These are what govern grain dynamics.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>grain motion can decouple the movement of dust from gas&lt;/li>
&lt;li>rapid motion can lead to grain destruction&lt;/li>
&lt;li>moving grains may help couple the neutral gas to the magnetic field where fractional ionization might be low (because grains can be charged)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="gas-drag">Gas drag&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Aerodynamic gas drag. There is a slowing down time, or &amp;ldquo;drag time&amp;rdquo; of
$$
\tau_\mathrm{drag} = \frac{M_\mathrm{gr} v}{F_\mathrm{drag}}.
$$
In diffuse clouds, gas drag can decelerate grains on relatively short timescales of only \(10^5\) yr.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lorentz-force">Lorentz force&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If grains have a velocity component transverse to the local magnetic field, then they will experience a Lorentz force.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="radiation-pressure-and-recoil-forces">Radiation pressure and recoil forces&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The interstellar radiation field is, in general, quite anisotropic (I mean, look around). The radiation pressure force on a grain is
$$
F_\mathrm{rad} = \langle Q_\mathrm{pr} \rangle \pi a^2 \Delta u_\mathrm{rad}.
$$
Radiation pressure can drive grains through the gas with appreciable velocities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the grain preferentially ejects atoms or electrons from the preferentially illuminated side of the grain, then the recoil can be large and accelerate the grain.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="poynting-robertson-effect">Poynting-Robertson effect&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Special Relativistic effect. Consider a dust grain orbiting a star.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of the abberation of starlight, in the instantaneous rest frame of the orbiting particle, the radiative flux from the star has a component in the direction antiparallel to the motion of the grain. The radiation acts to reduce the orbital momentum of the particle, and leads to an orbital decay that depends on the grain size.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For micron sized particles, PR drag can induce orbital decay of less than a Gyr for particles up to 10 cm in size.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="suprathermal-rotation-of-large-grains">Suprathermal rotation of large grains&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We would think classical grains would just be dominated by random collisions with gas atoms and you&amp;rsquo;d have the rotation temperature of the grain approximately equal to the gas temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, because the ISM is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> in LTE, interstellar grains act as heat engines, meaning they can attain suprathermal rotation rates where \(T_\mathrm{rot} \gg T_\mathrm{gas}\). This can happen by a variety of processes that impart a systematic torque on the grain.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Formation of molecular hydrogen on the grain surface, followed by impulsive ejection of said \(H_2\).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Emission of photoelectrons from grains exposed to UV radiation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Irregular grain surfaces&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Radiative torques due to absorption and scattering of starlight by irregular grains&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="rotation-of-small-grains-microwave-emission">Rotation of small grains: microwave emission&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For the very smallest grains \(a \lesssim 0.001\,\mu m\), rotational dynamics is complex. Any one of the following processes has an important effect on the angular momentum&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>random collisions with neutral gas atoms&lt;/li>
&lt;li>collisions of neutral or negatively charged grains with positive ions&lt;/li>
&lt;li>fluctuating electric fields due to passing ions acting on the permanent electric dipole moment of the grain&lt;/li>
&lt;li>angular momentum deposition by absorbed starlight photons&lt;/li>
&lt;li>angular momentum loss to radiated IR photons&lt;/li>
&lt;li>angular momentum loss in electric dipole radiation from the spinning grain&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="alignment-of-interstellar-dust">Alignment of Interstellar dust&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Interstellar grains are observed to be systematically aligned with their short axis tending parallel to the local magnetic field. Still an open line of research, but the problem involves two separate problems of&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>align grain angular momentum with the magnetic field&lt;/li>
&lt;li>align nonspherical body of the grain with the grain angular momentum&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Goal&lt;/strong>: Discuss how the telescope proposal process works, using ALMA as a guide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This includes&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the technical components to writing and submitting a proposal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>tips on developing and strengthening your scientific idea&lt;/li>
&lt;li>how your proposal is reviewed and graded&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Why write a telescope proposal&lt;/em>? To get data to answer a scientific question. (Sometimes, the data needed to answer that scientific question might already exist in the archive. In that case, save the time writing a proposal and use the archival data to write your paper).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To start, let&amp;rsquo;s walk through the example proposal provided on the course Canvas page (&lt;code>Czekala_Proposal.pdf&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lifecycle-of-a-proposal">Lifecycle of a proposal&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is my own proposal, and it may be helpful to walk through a timeline of the project. This is a Cycle 6 proposal.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>2018: January and February&lt;/strong>: Start thinking seriously about ALMA proposals for the upcoming cycle based upon anticipated capabilities that have been hinted at throughout the previous year, through information provided at conferences and other venues, and brainstorming scientific questions that could be addressed with new data.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>2018: March ~15&lt;/strong>: Cycle 8 &lt;strong>call for proposals&lt;/strong> announced. This is where the capabilities for the upcoming cycle are definitively announced, along with the official (up-to-date) technical documents, and the proposal deadline is set (usually in mid-late April).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Speaking for myself, ~1 month is barely enough time to conceptualize, design, make figures for, edit, and submit one proposal even if &lt;em>I am doing nothing else&lt;/em>. So, if you are like me, either plan ahead &lt;em>before&lt;/em> the call for proposals is announced (relying upon documents from previous cycles), or truly clear your schedule of all other activities (most of the time this is impossible, hence the need to start early).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>2018 March - April ~20th&lt;/strong>: Turn brainstormed ideas into concrete proposals, download and examine relevant archival data, make figures, draft text, contact collaborators, iterate on proposal (leaving &amp;gt; 1 week time for comments, preferably 2 weeks), submit proposal&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Summer 2018&lt;/strong>: ALMA TAC &amp;ldquo;meets&amp;rdquo; and ranks proposals&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>August 2018&lt;/strong>: Ranking results released. For the proposal we&amp;rsquo;re about to review, I learned that I had received a &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo; ranking, which means that the proposal would be scheduled for the upcoming cycle, but with priority lower than the &amp;ldquo;A&amp;rdquo; ranked proposals.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>October 2018 - September 2019&lt;/strong>: The observing window for Cycle 6. My scheduled program might be observed anytime in this window, provided it is 1) observable 2) weather is good 3) no highly ranked programs are ahead of me&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>October 3rd, 2018&lt;/strong>: I get a notification that the program was observed, hooray! (For a &amp;ldquo;B&amp;rdquo;-ranked program, this wasn&amp;rsquo;t guaranteed).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>November 2018&lt;/strong>: Calibrated data available for download from NAASC.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>November 2018 - February 2021&lt;/strong>: Work on data analysis, writing, etc (among other things). [Proprietary period expired November 2019]. 25 months&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>February 2021&lt;/strong>: Submit paper to &lt;em>Astrophysical Journal&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>March 2021&lt;/strong>: (Mercifully quick) referee process and acceptance to &lt;em>Astrophysical Journal&lt;/em>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s now take a look at the proposal itself and the &lt;a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...912....6C/abstract">paper&lt;/a> that resulted, and discuss the components.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="components-of-an-alma-proposal">Components of an ALMA proposal&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>

&lt;li>Scientific Justification&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="discussion-questions">Discussion questions&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For observationally-oriented projects, what is the &lt;em>minimum&lt;/em> time to go from proposal idea to getting data? What is a reasonable time to go from getting data to publication?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What about the role of archival data in preparing a new proposal? Unpublished archival data (proprietary period has passed)?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-happens-in-the-review-process">What happens in the review process?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://almascience.nrao.edu/news/alma-cycle-8-2021-proposal-review-process">Overview of the ALMA Cycle 8 proposal review process&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cycle 8 had 1735 total proposals, of which 253 were selected to be observed as &amp;ldquo;high priority&amp;rdquo; (grade A + B). Over 1000 people participated in the review process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is the observatory looking for? To do the &lt;strong>best science&lt;/strong> (as defined by the scientific community) with &lt;strong>limited resources&lt;/strong> (time).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dual-anonymous-proposals">Dual anonymous proposals&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In recent cycles, ALMA has followed a &lt;a href="https://almascience.nrao.edu/proposing/alma-proposal-review/dual-anonymous">dual-anonymous proposal strategy&lt;/a>. This means that the proposers do not know the reviewers&amp;rsquo; identities, nor do the reviewers know the proposers&amp;rsquo; identities. This strategy is also employed by HST and JWST review panels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dual-anonymous review processes are designed to insulate against many biases (prestige, gender, seniority, &amp;hellip;) that may affect the quality of a reviewer&amp;rsquo;s judgement. Speaking from my own experience from serving as a reviewer on dual-anonymous and non-anonymized panels, I very much prefer the dual-anonymous format. In panel discussions, it reduces &amp;ldquo;background noise&amp;rdquo; from the reputation (or lack thereof) of the proposer, removes many political dimensions, and forces the committee to focus solely on the scientific and technical merits of the proposal. In the end, this improves the ability of the observatory to do the best science with limited resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-are-you-asked-to-do-as-a-reviewer">What are you asked to do as a reviewer?&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The following is from the Cycle 8 &lt;a href="https://almascience.nrao.edu/proposing/alma-proposal-review/guidelines-for-reviewers">Guidelines for Reviewers&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="assessing-proposals">Assessing proposals&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Reviewers should assess the scientific merit of the proposals to the best of their ability using the following criteria:
&lt;em>The overall scientific merit of the proposed investigation and its potential contribution to the advancement of scientific knowledge.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Does the proposal clearly indicate which important, outstanding questions will be addressed?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Will the proposed observations have a high scientific impact on this particular field and address the specific science goals of the proposal? ALMA encourages reviewers to give full consideration to well-designed high-risk/high-impact proposals even if there is no guarantee of a positive outcome or definite detection.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Does the proposal present a clear and appropriate data analysis plan?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;em>The suitability of the observations to achieve the scientific goals&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Is the choice of target (or targets) clearly described and well justified?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Are the requested signal-to-noise ratio, angular resolution, spectral setup, and u-v coverage sufficient to achieve the science goals?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In general, the scientific merit should be assessed solely on the content of the proposal, according to the above criteria. Proposals may contain references to published papers (including preprints) as per standard practice in the scientific literature. Consultation of those references should not, however, be required for a general understanding of the proposal.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="writing-reviews-to-the-pis">Writing reviews to the PIs&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Clear and thoughtful reviews from reviewers can help PIs improve their proposed project and write stronger proposals in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Summarize both the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>A summary of both the strengths and weaknesses can help PIs understand what aspects of the project are strong, and which aspects need to be improved in any future proposal.
Reviews should focus on the major strengths and major weaknesses. Avoid giving the impression that a minor weakness was the cause of a poor ranking. Many proposals do not have obvious weaknesses but are just less compelling than others; in such a case, acknowledge that the considered proposal is good but that there were others that were more compelling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take care to ensure that the strengths and weaknesses do not contradict each other.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="2">
&lt;li>Be objective.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Be as specific as possible when commenting on the proposal. Avoid generic statements that could apply to most proposals.
If necessary, provide references to support your critique.
All reviews should be impersonal, critiquing the proposal and not the proposal team. For example, do not write &amp;ldquo;The PI did not adequately describe recent observations of this source.&amp;rdquo;, but instead write &amp;ldquo;The proposal did not adequately describe recent observations of this source.”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reviewers cannot be sure at the time of writing reviews whether the proposed observations will be scheduled for execution. The reviews should be phrased in such a way that they are sensible and meaningful regardless of the final outcome.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="3">
&lt;li>Be concise.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>It is not necessary to write a lengthy review. An informative review can be only a few sentences in length if it is concise and informative. But, please avoid writing only a single sentence that does not address specific strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="4">
&lt;li>Be professional and constructive.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>It is never appropriate to write inflammatory or inappropriate comments, even if you think a proposal could be greatly improved.
Use complete sentences when writing your reviews. We understand that many reviewers are not native English speakers, but please try to use correct grammar, spelling, and punctuation.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="5">
&lt;li>Be aware of unconscious bias.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We all have biases and we need to make special efforts to review the proposals objectively. A discussion of unconscious bias is provided here.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="6">
&lt;li>Be anonymous.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Do not identify yourself in the reviews to the PIs. In case of distributed peer review, these reviews will not be checked and edited by the JAO. They will be sent verbatim to the PIs, and they will also be shared with other reviewers during Stage 2.
Do not spend time trying to guess who is the proposal team behind the proposal you are reviewing. Your review should be based solely on the scientific merit of the proposal.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="7">
&lt;li>Other best practices.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Do not summarize the proposal: The purpose of the review is to evaluate the scientific merits of the proposal, not to summarize it. While you may provide a concise overview of the proposal, it should not constitute the bulk of the reviews.
Do not include statements about scheduling feasibility. If there are any scheduling feasibility issues with the proposal, the JAO will address them directly with the PI.
Do not include explicit references to other proposals that you are reviewing, such as project codes.
Do not ask questions. A question is usually an indirect way to indicate there is a weakness in the proposal, but the weakness should be stated explicitly. For example, instead of &amp;ldquo;Why was a sample size of 10 chosen?&amp;rdquo; write &amp;ldquo;The proposal did not provide a strong justification for the sample size of 10.&amp;rdquo;
Do not use sarcasm or any insulting language.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="8">
&lt;li>Re-read your reviews and scientific rankings.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Once you have completed your assessments, re-read your reviews and ask how you would react if you received them. If you feel that the reviews would upset you, revise them.
Check to see if the strengths and weaknesses in the reviews are consistent with the scientific rankings. If not, consider revising the reviews or the rankings.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>For ALMA distributed TAC, you are asked to review 10 proposals for every proposal that you submit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For something like the JWST TAC, you might be asked to read about 70 proposals for which you are not conflicted. 30-40 of them will be as &amp;ldquo;primary&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;secondary&amp;rdquo; reviewer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is also an ALMA review panel for proposals asking for more than 25 hours of time, which meets and discusses the proposals.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Good review committees will make sure that the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal are adequately discussed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes (especially for highly oversubscribed calls), there are very few weaknesses identified for a proposal. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily mean that your proposal should have been accepted over ones that were! In very competitive reviews, it&amp;rsquo;s common to just have proposals that were a more compelling use of the observatory&amp;rsquo;s limited resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When writing a review, try to put yourself into the shoes of the proposer receiving the comments, and strive to write accurate and constructive comments. Avoid commentary about the individual (in a dual-anonymous review process, this trap is harder to fall into). Rather, focus on the content of the &lt;em>proposal&lt;/em> and the &lt;em>scientific plan&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Reviews tend to be concise (remember, serving on a TAC is usually a &lt;em>voluntary&lt;/em> service to the community, and reviewers might need to write and review comments for over 40 proposals).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="tac-review-assignment">TAC Review Assignment&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At the end of this lecture, you will be provided with a packed of 5 actual ALMA proposals that I have sourced from my generous colleagues.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It is your job to review these as if you were serving on the ALMA time allocation committee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, please read the &lt;a href="https://almascience.nrao.edu/proposing/alma-proposal-review/guidelines-for-reviewers">ALMA Guidelines for reviewers document&lt;/a>. Then, &lt;em>for each proposal&lt;/em>, you will be expected to write a review at least 100 words in length, though it&amp;rsquo;s not a bad idea to aim for 150 - 200 words.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These reviews are due Monday, November 1st, and are worth 5% of your final grade. In addition, you will be asked to grade each proposal on a numerical scale of 1 to 5 (1 being the best, 5 the worst.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I will also designate each student as the &amp;ldquo;primary&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;secondary&amp;rdquo; reviewer for a proposal. On Wednesday, November 3rd and Friday, November 5th, class will be devoted to a mock TAC discussion. The idea is that, as primary reviewer, you will lead the discussion about the proposal. As secondary reviewer, you will be asked to provide any additional thoughts that the primary reviewer may not have covered. The other TAC members are welcome to comment on any proposal, even if they are not primary or secondary reviewers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, as a TAC, we will decide on a collective ranking of the proposals. Once this is complete, we will examine how the proposals were actually ranked by the real ALMA TAC, and discuss.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="alma-proposal-final-project">ALMA Proposal Final Project&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>After we complete the review process on Nov 5th, it might be a good time to start thinking about your final project, which will be the scientific justification component of an ALMA proposal (modeled on the Cycle 8 call for proposals).

&lt;h2 id="cross-sections-and-efficiency-factors">Cross sections and efficiency factors&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In analogy to our previous setups with scattering cross sections, which we wrote as \(\sigma\), we&amp;rsquo;ll define other cross sections that are useful for talking about grains and radiative transfer. At least in this chapter, Draine labels them by \(C\), and many of them have a dependence on wavelength. They still have units of area, \(\mathrm{cm}^2\).&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>absorption cross section&lt;/strong> \(C_\mathrm{abs}(\lambda)\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>scattering cross section&lt;/strong> \(C_\mathrm{sca}(\lambda)\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>extinction cross section&lt;/strong>
$$
C_\mathrm{ext}(\lambda) = C_\mathrm{abs}(\lambda) + C_\mathrm{sca}(\lambda)
$$&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="a-brief-note-about-radiative-transfer-with-scattering-included">A brief note about radiative transfer with scattering included&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>For a population of identical dust grains with number density \(n\), the extinction cross section is related to the attenuation coefficient by the relation
$$
\kappa_\lambda = n C_\mathrm{ext}(\lambda).
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you remember back to our radiative transfer lecture, we neglected scattering in nearly all applications. Now, we&amp;rsquo;re including scattering for dust, and that means that radiative transfer gets &lt;strong>hard&lt;/strong>. We can still calculate the optical depth
$$
\tau_\nu = \int_0^s \kappa_\lambda d s,
$$
however, to calculate an emergent intensity we can&amp;rsquo;t just plug it into the integral form of the RTE like we did before. \(\boldsymbol{x}\) and \(\boldsymbol{n}\) are vectors. Here is an example including the sink and source terms due to scattering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The sink term is added simply by using \(\kappa_\mathrm{ext}\), which includes the attenuation due to scattering. The problem starts to get gnarly when we consider the &lt;em>source&lt;/em> term due to scattering. Basically, light can be scattered &lt;em>into&lt;/em> the ray under consideration (attenuating the ray from which it originated). The modified RTE looks like&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\frac{d I}{d s}(x, n, \lambda) = - \kappa_\mathrm{ext}(x, \lambda) I(x, n, \lambda) + j_*(x, n, \lambda) + \kappa_\mathrm{sca}(x, \lambda) \int_{4 \pi} \Phi(n, n^\prime, x, \lambda) I(x, n^\prime, \lambda) d \Omega^\prime
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>where \(\Phi\) term is a scattering phase function, which describes the probability that a photon originally propagating in direction \(\boldsymbol{n}^\prime\) and scattered at position \(\boldsymbol{x}\) will have \(\boldsymbol{n}\) as its new propagation direction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is called an &lt;em>integro-differential&lt;/em> equation. It sounds hard because it is, and all radiation fields in all positions in all directions (and for all wavelengths) are coupled! For more information on the complexities of radiative transfer including dust, see the review article &lt;a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ARA%26A..51...63S/abstract">Steinacker ARA&amp;amp;A&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="back-to-terms">Back to terms&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>albedo&lt;/strong>
$$
\omega \equiv \frac{C_\mathrm{sca}(\lambda)}{C_\mathrm{abs}(\lambda) + C_\mathrm{sca}(\lambda)} = \frac{C_\mathrm{sca}(\lambda)}{C_\mathrm{ext}(\lambda)}.
$$
An albedo of 1 means that scattering dominates the extinction (shiny silver thing), an albedo of 0 means that absorption dominates (pure black).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a given direction of incidence to a fixed grain, you need two angles \(\theta, \phi\) to fully specify the scattering direction, since it can be in any direction in 3D space. However, if we are talking about spherical grains, or a large ensemble of randomly oriented grains, then we only need to talk about a single scattering angle \(\theta\). A value of 0 means that the light is scattered in the forward direction, a value of 180 means that the light is scattered backwards (back-scattered), and a value of 90 would have the light be scattered to the right, left, top, or bottom.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We can write down a &lt;strong>differential scattering cross section&lt;/strong>
$$
\frac{d C_\mathrm{sca}(\theta)}{d \Omega}
$$
for incident unpolarized light to be scattered by an angle \(\theta\).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We can calculate the &lt;strong>mean value&lt;/strong> of \(\cos \theta\) (scattering angle) by taking the average over all angles
$$
\langle \cos \theta \rangle = \frac{1}{C_\mathrm{sca}} \int_0^\pi \cos \theta \frac{d C_\mathrm{sca}(\theta)}{d \Omega} 2 \pi \sin \theta d \theta
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We can calculate the radiation pressure cross section
$$
C_\mathrm{pr}(\lambda) \equiv C_\mathrm{abs}(\lambda) + (1 - \langle \cos \theta \rangle C_\mathrm{sca}(\lambda)).
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>And we also have the &lt;strong>degree of polarization&lt;/strong> for light scattered through an angle \(P(\theta)\).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Frequently it&amp;rsquo;s convenient to work with a dimensionless cross section that is normalized to some characteristic area of the grain. For a spherical grain, the geometric grain cross section is a good one: \(\pi a^2\). Draine adopts the following convention for a non-spherical grain: create a sphere having the same volume \(V\) as the grain material (not including voids) and use the effective cross section of that sphere: \(\pi a_\mathrm{eff}^2\), where
$$
a_\mathrm{eff} = \left( \frac{3 V}{4 \pi} \right)^{1/3}.
$$
Then we have
$$
Q_\mathrm{sca} = \frac{C_\mathrm{sca}}{\pi a_\mathrm{eff}^2}
$$
$$
Q_\mathrm{abs} = \frac{C_\mathrm{abs}}{\pi a_\mathrm{eff}^2}
$$
and
$$
Q_\mathrm{ext} \equiv Q_\mathrm{sca} + Q_\mathrm{abs}
$$
and all of the \(Q\) terms are dimensionless.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="index-of-refraction">Index of refraction&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The index of refraction will indicate whether a dust grain is better at absorbing or scattering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This can be done with the complex dielectric function
$$
\epsilon(\omega) = \epsilon_r + i \epsilon_r
$$
or the refractive index \(m(\omega)\) where \(m = \sqrt{\epsilon}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The index of refraction is a complex number with real and imaginary parts
$$
m = m_r + i m_i.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The real part \(m_r\) is called the refractive index and determines how much a beam of light is bent (or refracted)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The imaginary part \(m_i\) is called the absorption index, since it determines how strongly the substance absorbs light.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Both \(m_r\) and \(m_i\) are real and non-negative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider an electromagnetic wave with field strength
$$
E \propto e^{i(kx - \omega t)}
$$
traveling through a material. The dispersion relationship between wavenumber and frequency will be
$$
k = m \frac{\omega}{c}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the imaginary part of \(m\) is greater than zero, then the power of the electromagnetic wave will decrease as it propagates through the material
$$
|E|^2 \propto e^{-2 \mathrm{Im}(m) \omega x/c}
$$
and thus the attenuation coefficient for that light will be
$$
\kappa(\omega) = 2 m_i \frac{\omega}{c} = \frac{4 \pi m_i}{\lambda_\mathrm{vac}}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="limit-that-grain-much-smaller-than-wavelength-of-light">Limit that grain much smaller than wavelength of light&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now we will consider the situation where the grain is much smaller than the wavelength of incident radiation. In such a situation, it&amp;rsquo;s as if the grain is subject to an incident applied electric field that is uniform in space&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The efficiency factors have the form&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>absorption&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>$$
Q_\mathrm{abs} = 4 \left ( \frac{2 \pi a }{\lambda} \right) \mathrm{Im} \left [ \frac{m^2 - 1}{m^2 + 2} \right].
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>which yields an absorption coefficient
$$
\kappa_\mathrm{abs} \propto n_\mathrm{gr} a^3.
$$
So, you can think of the absorption coefficient as being proportional to the fraction of the volume of space that is occupied by dust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For scattering, the efficiency factor is
$$
Q_\mathrm{sca} = \frac{8}{3} \left ( \frac{2 \pi a}{\lambda} \right)^4 \left | \frac{m^2 - 1}{m^2 + 2} \right |^2.
$$
or the relationship that
$$
\sigma_\mathrm{sca} \propto a^6 \lambda^{-4}
$$
which is characteristic of Rayleigh scattering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As long as there is any absorption at all, absorption will dominate over scattering in the limit that the grain radius goes to zero. E.g., you can see this by the fact that the optical/UV extinction curve has a shape much closer to \(\lambda^{-1}\) than \(\lambda^{-4}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="regime-where-sizes-are-comparable">Regime where sizes are comparable&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Use Mie theory to calculate the absorption and scattering coefficients. Basically, the electric field inside and outside the sphere can be decomposed into spherical harmonics with appropriate radial functions, and then determine the coefficients by the boundary conditions that you have a plane wave at infinity and that you have continuity at the surface of the sphere. In modern applications, you would write/use a computer program to calculate these coefficients.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="regime-where-2-pi-a-gg-lambda">Regime where \(2 \pi a \gg \lambda\)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Might want to use Mie theory, but there are some useful approximations. As you take the limit of larger grains relative to the wavelength you get the strange result that
$$
Q_\mathrm{ext} \rightarrow 2.
$$
Now, if you remember the definition of \(Q_\mathrm{ext} \), this means that the extinction cross-section is &lt;em>twice&lt;/em> that of its geometric cross section. It&amp;rsquo;s as if you had a large opaque bowling ball, but with twice the cross-sectional area. This result is called the &amp;ldquo;extinction paradox.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It comes about because of diffraction effects. According to &lt;strong>Babinet&amp;rsquo;s principle&lt;/strong> the scattering produced by an opaque object is the same as that produced by an aperture of the same size cut into an opaque screen. So the diffraction pattern of an opaque sphere of radius \(a\) is the same as the Airy pattern produced by a hole of radius \(a\) cut into a screen, and in the short-wavelength limit you get \(Q_\mathrm{abs} = 1\) and \(Q_\mathrm{sca} = 1\) so \(Q_\mathrm{ext} = 2\).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The widespread existence of dust came about in the work by Robert Trumpler in 1930, when he studied open clusters in our Galaxy. Basically, he treated bright main sequence stars as standard candles, the size of clusters as standard rulers, and found that things didn&amp;rsquo;t correlate the way he might expect just from the inverse square law alone. Instead, he found a better fit if the light was attenuated exponentially
$$
I_\lambda = I_{\lambda, 0} e^{-\kappa_\lambda r}
$$
with a wavelength dependence such that bluer wavelengths suffered larger attenuation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Dust&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>dims light (overall)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>dims blue optical wavelengths more than red optical or infrared wavelengths&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Trumpler hypothesized that this could be due to Rayleigh scattering from &amp;ldquo;fine cosmic dust particles.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="effect-of-dust-on-observations">Effect of dust on observations&lt;/h2>

&lt;li>Dust particles &lt;em>scatter&lt;/em> light. We see this in reflection nebulae.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dust particles also &lt;em>absorb&lt;/em> light.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The net effect of scattering and absorption is called &lt;em>extinction&lt;/em>. Extinction can depend on the polarization of the light, and so dust can also polarize light.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The relative amount of scattering and absorbing depends on the properties of the dust grains.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can write the observed flux of a star as
$$
F_\lambda = F_{\lambda, 0} e^{-\tau_\lambda}
$$
basically, the original flux attenuated by a medium with some optical depth.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There isn&amp;rsquo;t much starlight at energies \(h \nu &amp;gt; 13.6\) eV, so dust extinction studies have generally focused on near UV and optical \(\lambda &amp;gt; 912\) angstroms.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because optical astronomers are usually making these calculations, we&amp;rsquo;re usually working in &lt;em>magnitudes&lt;/em>. So, we can write the ratio of the original flux to the attenuated flux relative as a number of magnitudes of extinction. The definition is&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
A_\lambda = 2.5 \log_{10} \left ( \frac{F_{\lambda, 0}}{F_\lambda } \right)
$$
making the relationship between magnitudes and optical depth
$$
A_\lambda = 2.5 \log_{10}(e^{\tau_\nu}) \approx 1.086 \tau_\lambda.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The exctinction curve as a function of wavelength looks like the following&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="fig6-2.jpg"
alt="Dust exctinction as a function of wavelength, normalized relative to \(A_V\), the extinction in the V band. Credit: Ryden and Pogge, Figure 6.2. data from Cardelli&amp;#43;94 and O&amp;amp;rsquo;Donnell 94."/>&lt;figcaption>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>and this is determined by comparing the spectrum of a nearby (un-extincted) star to a more distant star of the same spectral type.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cardelli+89 showed that the extinction relative to some reference wavelength can be described as a function
$$
A_\lambda / A_{\lambda_\mathrm{ref}} \approx f(\lambda)
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The actual functional form is a non-parametric spline fit with seven free parameters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first thing you should notice is that bluer wavelengths (in particular UV and blue optical) are much more heavily extincted than redder wavelengths (red optical and near-infrared). This means that dust will &lt;em>attenuate&lt;/em> and &lt;em>redden&lt;/em> the light from a star.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is also an excess extinction feature at \(\lambda \approx 2175\) angstroms, which is attributed to carbon rich particles. It is metallicity dependent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At optical wavelengths, the extinction is a bit simpler. At optical and near-UV wavelengths, the functional form can be approximated by a one-parameter family of curves
$$
A_\lambda / A_{\lambda_\mathrm{ref}} \approx f(\lambda; R_V)
$$
where that one parameter is \(R_V\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The redenning is commonly expressed in terms of a color excess between B and V optical bands,
$$
E(B-V) = A_B - A_V
$$
and is usually a positive number.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you assume that the extinction curve is the same everywhere, then by knowing \(A_V\) you would be able to calculate \(E(B-V)\) (or vice-versa). Unfortunately it&amp;rsquo;s not guaranteed to be the same everywhere, and in fact, the &lt;em>ratio of total to selective extinction&lt;/em> is
$$
R_V \equiv \frac{A_V}{E(B-V)}
$$
and ranges for values of \(2 \lesssim R_V \lesssim 6\) for interstellar dust, which means that for every magnitude of \(V\)-band extinction, you&amp;rsquo;re going to get 1.2 - 1.5 magnitudes of B band extinction. You can think of \(R_V\) as the inverse of the slope of the extinction curve at optical wavelengths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If \(R_V \rightarrow \infty\), then you have a &amp;ldquo;grey&amp;rdquo; absorber where all wavelengths of light are absorbed equally. This would also be what happens if we were in the &amp;ldquo;geometric optics&amp;rdquo; limit, where the dust grains were large compared to the wavelength. The fact that we do see extinction rise with wavelength means that small grains (\(a \lesssim 0.015\,\mu m\)) must be making an appreciable contribution to extinction at observed wavelengths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most commonly adopted value is \(R_V = 3.1\) for general ISM.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the Milky Way Galaxy, the amount of dust extinction along a line of sight is found to be correlated with the total column density of hydrogen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For sightlines with \(R_V \approx 3.1\),
$$
\frac{N_H}{A_V} \approx 1.9 \times 10^{21}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\;\mathrm{mag}^{-1}.
$$
This is a really useful relationship because if you&amp;rsquo;ve measured the exctinction, then you can estimate the column density of hydrogen, or vice-versa.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And realistically, you&amp;rsquo;d try to combine as much information that you can in our galaxy, including dust emission, and then you can produce a map of extinction for any extragalactic source. The most famous of these papers is the &amp;ldquo;SFD&amp;rdquo; paper by Schlegel, Finkbeiner, and Davis. Even at high galactic latitudes, there can still be some extinction (~0.05 mags \(A_V\))&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Because some exctinction is caused by absorption instead of scattering, dust grains are heated by (optical) starlight, after which they then cool by the emission of infrared light.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In our Milky Way Galaxy, the infrared portion of the interstellar radiation field peaks at \(\lambda \approx 140\,\mu m\), which corresponds to dust temperatures of 100 K.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using the hydrogen column density on a typical sightline through our galaxy, we can make an order of magnitude calculation as to the infrared luminosity per hydrogen nucleus
$$
\frac{I_\mathrm{IR}}{N_H} = 5 \times 10^{-24}\,\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By comparision, the Sun&amp;rsquo;s luminosity per hydrogen nucleus is
$$
\sim L_\odot m_H / M_\odot \approx 3 \times 10^{-24}\,\mathrm{erg\,s}^{-1}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we took a lot of liberty here in the approximations, but the ISM is &lt;em>about as efficient as converting sunlight into infrared light as the Sun is at creating sunlight to begin with&lt;/em>. This has important implications for the observations of external galaxies&amp;mdash;for some with large dust content, the amount of energy in IR radiation is comparable to that contained in optical starlight.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, the dust in a galaxy is efficient at absorbing optical starlight and re-radiating it as infrared emission.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Radiative Trapping</title><link>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/17-radiative-trapping/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/17-radiative-trapping/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://psu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/Astro+542A+Lecture+Oct+6/1_zra8cex4">Zoom link&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In many situations, like dense molecular clouds or stellar outflows, we have sufficient gas densities that a photon emitted by
$$
X_u \rightarrow X_l
$$
will have a high probability of being absorbed by another \(X_l\) nearby, and, thus, a low probability of ever escaping from the region and being seen by an observer. This is called &lt;strong>radiative trapping&lt;/strong>. The consequences are&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>reducing the emission from \(X_u \rightarrow X_l\) emerging from the region&lt;/li>
&lt;li>changes the level populations of \(X\) relative to what would be calculated if the photons escaped&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is (one of the reasons) why radiative transfer can be hard in practice: excitation is coupled across non-local scales. One way to simplify things a tiny bit is to use the &lt;strong>escape probability approximation&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="escape-probability-approximation">Escape probability approximation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Consider some slab of material that has light passing through it. The optical depth through this slab is \(\tau_\nu\). What is the probability that the photon makes it through the slab without being absorbed?
$$
\beta = e^{-\tau_\nu}.
$$
I.e.,&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>if \(\tau_\nu \approx 0\), the photon will pass through with probability of 1 (it will nearly always go through).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>if \(\tau_\nu \gtrsim 1\), the photon will pass through with probability of 0 (it will nearly always be absorbed).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now, let&amp;rsquo;s consider some location \(\boldsymbol{r}\) within a cloud, and we&amp;rsquo;re looking in a direction \(\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The total optical depth (i.e., integrated until we&amp;rsquo;re out of the cloud) in that direction is \(\tau_\nu(\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}, \boldsymbol{r}) \).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Q&lt;/strong>: If an atom at this location emitted a photon (in a random direction), what would be the probability that it would escape the cloud?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A&lt;/strong>: We&amp;rsquo;d need to average over all directions
$$
\bar{\beta}_\nu( \boldsymbol{r}) \equiv \int \frac{d \Omega}{4 \pi} e^{-\tau_nu(\hat{\boldsymbol{n}}, \boldsymbol{r})}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve been treating the escape probability at a single frequency. But let&amp;rsquo;s say we wanted to treat the escape probability averaged over the line profile
$$
\langle \beta(\boldsymbol{r}) \rangle = \int \phi_\nu \bar{\beta}_\nu( \boldsymbol{r}) d \nu.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, let&amp;rsquo;s re-examine the level population calculations using the escape probability approximation and making a few more assumptions&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>excitation level is uniform throughout the cloud&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;on-the-spot&amp;rdquo;: if a radiated photon will be absorbed, it&amp;rsquo;s absorbed close to (at) the point of emission&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Plan&lt;/strong>: start with the rate of change of populations for a two-level system, incorporate the escape probabilities, and see what&amp;rsquo;s changed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\frac{d n_u}{d t} = \left ( n_c k_{lu} + n_\gamma \frac{g_u}{g_l} A_{ul} \right) n_l - \left ( n_c k_{ul} + A_{ul} + n_\gamma A_{ul} \right) n_u
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because the cloud is uniformly excited, we can take the RTE in integral form and rewrite it as
$$
I_\nu = I_\nu(0) e^{-\tau_\nu} + B_\nu(T_\mathrm{exc})(1 - e^{-\tau_\nu})
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and then rewrite it in terms of photon number&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
n_\gamma(\nu) = n_\gamma^{(0)} e^{-\tau_\nu} + \frac{1 - e^{-\tau_\nu}}{(n_l g_u)/(n_u g_l) - 1}
$$
where&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
n_\gamma^{(0)} \equiv \frac{c^2}{2 h \nu^3} I_\nu(0).
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>we can introduce \(\beta_\nu\), do the average over direction and line profile, and obtain&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\langle n_\gamma \rangle = \langle \bar{\beta} \rangle n_\gamma^{(0)} + \frac{1 - \langle \bar{\beta} \rangle}{(n_l g_u/n_u g_l) - 1}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then we can rewrite the rate of change of level populations to be
$$
\frac{d n_u}{d t} = n_c k_{lu} n_l + n_c k_{ul} n_u - \langle \bar{\beta}\rangle A_{ul} n_u + n_l \frac{g_u}{g_l} \langle \bar{\beta}\rangle A_{ul} n_\gamma^{(0)} \left (1 - \frac{n_u g_l}{n_l g_u} \right),
$$
which is called the &lt;strong>escape probability approximation&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What have we done? We started with an equation that included photoexcitation and stimulated emission, including the effects of photons emitted by the cloud material, which is valid in the optically thick regime as well as optically thin. This was tricky to solve in the optically thick regime, because the terms were &lt;strong>coupled across large distances&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have used the escape probability approximation and written down an equation that the level populations must satisfy, taking into account all of the radiative processes (absorption, spontaneous emission, and stimulated emission), and photons both originating externally and emitted with the cloud, assuming we know the value of the escape probability \(\langle \bar{\beta} \rangle\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This modified equation is nice because it functionally looks like an equation we&amp;rsquo;d write down with&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>no internally generated radiation field present&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cloud was optically thin to external radiation field \(I_\nu(0)\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the Einstein A coefficient replaced by an effective value \(\langle \hat{\beta}\rangle A_{ul}\).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Because this is functionally &amp;ldquo;optically thin,&amp;rdquo; we&amp;rsquo;ve decoupled the terms across distances and can use it to calculate level populations in a much more straightforward manner.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Can also be applied to the case of scattering.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The angle-averaged escape probability depends on the geometry and velocity structure of the region, e.g., escape probability will be largest at cloud boundary and lowest in cloud center. There are ways to define a mass-averaged escape probability over the cloud volume (see Draine 19.2).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Frequently used as a tracer of molecular gas. Can follow through from an assumption of Gaussian velocity distribution, and known quantities about partition functions. Given these, we usually find that at least the J=1-0 level of CO is expected to be thermalized in molecular clouds.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Also called Sobolev approximation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If there is a velocity gradient such that point-to-point differences across the flow field are large compared to the width of the velocity distribution at a given point, then you can get more emission out of the cloud (it has more frequency bandwidth on which to emit).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Observers of the cold ISM face a perennial problem in that most of the hydrogen mass in these regions is in molecular form \(\mathrm{H}_2\), but that molecule doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a dipole moment, and therefore does not readily emit, so it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;invisible.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s commonly assumed that CO 1-0 transition can be used as a tracer of molecular cloud mass.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assumptions underpinning this include virialized clouds (setting turbulent velocity dispersions). Depends on the density and temperature of the cloud.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Nebular Diagnostics</title><link>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/16-nebular-diagnostics/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/16-nebular-diagnostics/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://psu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/Astro+542A+Lecture+Oct+4/1_y8cn2wz4">Zoom link&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Goal&lt;/strong>: use emission features from an H II region or planetary nebulae to estimate its temperature and density&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ionized nebulae are far from blackbodies (not a terrible approximation for opaque bodies like stars). I.e., a blackbody &lt;em>absorbs&lt;/em> all incident radiation and emits blackbody radiation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A parcel of gas (say, containing neutral hydrogen atoms) can be in LTE (thermalized via collisions w/ free electrons) but not be a blackbody (i.e. emits via spectral lines, and continuum emission via free-free, free-bound, and two-photon emission).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Though the continuum emission does depend on density and temperature, because of the bright, spectrally concentrated nature of spectral line emission, this usually provides a more direct measurement.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="calculating-temperature">Calculating temperature&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A good rule of thumb for using emission lines is to find two excited states of the same ion (making sure you&amp;rsquo;re tracing the same conditions) whose energy levels differ by \(\sim k T\), where \(T\) is the temperature of the gas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If \(T \sim 10^4\) K, then we&amp;rsquo;re looking for energy differences on the order 1 eV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For H II regions, the following are useful&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>doubly ionized oxygen O III&lt;/li>
&lt;li>singly ionized nitrogen N II&lt;/li>
&lt;li>doubly ionized sulfur S III&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>all of these have similar electronic structure, they are 4 electrons short of a filled outer shell and therefore their lowest energy levels have a similar form.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="fig4-6.jpg"

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The ground state is \({}^3 \mathrm{P}_J\), which has fine structure sub-levels corresponding to angular momentum quantum levels \(J=0,1,2\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first excited state of the ion is written with \({}^1 \mathrm{D}\). A transition from this state to the \(J=1,2\) states of the ground state are forbidden magnetic dipole transitions, and the transition to the \(J=0\) is an even more strongly forbidden electric quadrupole transition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each of these transitions produce lines like [O III], [N II] that are in the optical band, and thus easily observable from the ground. These lines include those frequently termed &amp;ldquo;nebular lines&amp;rdquo; \({}^1 \mathrm{D} \rightarrow {}^3 \mathrm{P}_J \) (because they were first seen in planetary nebulae)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and &amp;ldquo;auroral lines&amp;rdquo; \({}^1 \mathrm{S} \rightarrow {}^1 \mathrm{D} \) because a similar line is seen in Earth&amp;rsquo;s aurorae. We number the different energy levels with numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 for simplicity, so we don&amp;rsquo;t need to keep using the spectroscopic notation. There are higher energy levels to the ions, but at typical temperatures in ISM they are essentially unpopulated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now let&amp;rsquo;s calculate temperature from observed line strength. First, assume we are in the low-density limit such that&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>\(n_e &amp;lt; n_\mathrm{crit} \) for each line under consideration&lt;/li>
&lt;li>meaning collisional excitation is followed by radiative de-excitation (not collisional de-excitation)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>radiative de-excitation will primarily be spontaneous instead of stimulated emission&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The emissivity from spontaneous emission is
$$
j_\nu = n_u \frac{A_{ul}}{4 \pi} h \nu_{ul} \Phi_\nu
$$
so, integrated over the line profile, we have
$$
j(4 \rightarrow 3) = n_4 \frac{A_{43}}{4 \pi} h \nu_{43}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we are in excitational equilibrium, the rate of collisional excitation from the ground state (remember, most things in ground state) to level 4 will be balanced by the radiative de-excitation from level 4.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For quantum mechanical reasons, transitions from 4 to 2 and 4 to 0 are strongly forbidden. Therefore we only need to take into account the transitions from 4 to 3 and 4 to 1
$$
n_0 n_e k_{04} = n_4 (A_{43} + A_{41}).
$$
We can use this with the previous equation to include the collinional rate coefficient (and thus the temperature dependence) in the emissivity as
$$
j(4 \rightarrow 3) = \frac{n_0 n_e}{4 \pi} k_{04} \frac{A_{43}}{A_{43} + A_{41}} h \nu_{43}
$$
the temperature dependence comes in through the \(k_{04}\) term.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now let&amp;rsquo;s consider the \(3\rightarrow 2\) line. Like the level 4 state, the level 3 state can be populated through direct collisional excitation, but it can also be populated through radiative de-excitation from the level 4 state. So, we would write&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
j(3 \rightarrow 2) = \frac{n_0 n_e}{4 \pi} \left [ k_{03} + k_{04} \frac{A_{43}}{A_{43} + A_{41}}\right] \frac{A_{32}}{A_{32} + A_{31}} h \nu_{32}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can get rid of the dependence on density by taking the ratio of the line strengths
$$
\frac{j(4 \rightarrow 3)}{j(3 \rightarrow 2)} = \frac{A_{43} \nu_{43}}{A_{32} \nu_{32}} \frac{(A_{32} + A_{31}) k_{04}}{(A_{43} + A_{41})k_{03} + A_{43} k_{04}}.
$$
All of the \(A\) terms are known from quantum mechanics, and the collisional rate coefficients are dependent on temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From the principle of detailed balance, we can relate the collisional rate coefficients by
$$
\frac{k_{0u}}{k_{u0}} = \frac{g_u}{g_0} \exp \left (- \frac{h \nu_{u0}}{k T} \right).
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In practice, there are some simplifications and factorizations that occur. First, we write the collision de-excitation rate cofficient as
$$
k_{u0} = \frac{\beta}{T^{1/2}} \frac{\Omega_{u0}}{g_u}
$$
where
$$
\beta = \left ( \frac{2 \pi \hbar^4}{k m_e^3} \right)^{1/2}
$$
and \(\Omega_{u0}\) is a dimensionless collision strength. \(\Omega_{u0}\) is nearly independent of temperature (and of order unity) so \(k_{u0} \propto T^{-1/2}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can refactor the line strength ratios into
$$
\frac{j(4 \rightarrow 3)}{j(3 \rightarrow 2)} = \frac{A_{43} \nu_{43}}{A_{32} \nu_{32}} \frac{(A_{32} + A_{31}) \Omega_{40} \exp(- h \nu_{43}/kT)}{(A_{43} + A_{41} \Omega_{30})+ A_{43} \Omega_{40} \exp(- h \nu_{43} / kT)}.
$$
The temperature dependence is now isolated to the exponent. We&amp;rsquo;re going to get the most variation in the line ratios for temperatures \(kT \approx h \nu_{43}\), which is 1.96 eV for S III and 2.84 eV for O III.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="calculating-density">Calculating density&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To calculate density, its helpful to identify an ion with two electronic transitions that are similar in energy but have very different critical densities. One good example is singly ionized oxygen, O II.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember that critical density
$$
n_\mathrm{crit} = \frac{(1 + n_\gamma) A_{ul}}{k_{ul}}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first excited state \({}^2 \mathrm{D}^O\) is split into a pair of fine structure sub-levels, whose energies are finely separated. Thus, the transitions from the first excited state to ground produce a line doublet (two lines closely spaced in wavelength). The critical densities for the different lines of the doublet, however, are substantially different.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="fig4-7.jpg"

&lt;p>Energy levels of the O II and S II ions. Credit: Ryden and Pogge Figure 4.7&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Following a similar path as before, we&amp;rsquo;ll write down the emissivities for each line of the doublet and then compute their ratios, and do some simplifications using collisional strengths to get&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\frac{j(2\rightarrow 0)}{j(1 \rightarrow 0)} \approx \frac{\Omega_{02}}{\Omega_{01}} \frac{1 + n_e/n_{\mathrm{crit},1}}{1 + n_e/n_{\mathrm{crit},2}}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the low-density limit, we have
$$
\frac{j(2\rightarrow 0)}{j(1 \rightarrow 0)} \approx \frac{\Omega_{02}}{\Omega_{01}},
$$
the line ratios are independent of the free electron density \(n_e\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the high density limit, we have
$$
\frac{j(2\rightarrow 0)}{j(1 \rightarrow 0)} \approx \frac{\Omega_{02}}{\Omega_{01}}\frac{n_{\mathrm{crit},2}}{n_{\mathrm{crit},1}},
$$
which is again independent of the free electron density \(n_e\) (but does depend on the critical densities of each transition).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get something that does depend on the free electron density, we need to be in the regime where \(n_e\) is larger than one critical density but smaller than the other. For the O II transition we&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about, you can get line ratios that range from 0.4 to 1.4, which is a decent dynamic range.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And, of course, in a modern analysis, usually multiple temperature and density diagnostics are combined into a single estimate of temperature and density.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Let the number densities of the two levels of the atom be given by \(n_0\) and \(n_1\), and the number density of the collisional partner (e.g., electrons) be given by \(n_c\). Then,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rate of change of the excited state is
$$
\frac{d n_1}{d t} = n_c n_0 k_{01} - n_c n_1 k_{10} - n_1 A_{10}.
$$
i.e., it&amp;rsquo;s equal to how quickly level 1 is populated via collisions, minus how quickly level 1 is depopulated via collisions, minus how quickly level 1 is depopulated via spontaneous emission. Steady-state solution is \(dn_1/dt = 0\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The law of mass action and the principle of detailed balance allow us to relate the collisional rate coefficients by
$$
\frac{k_{01}}{k_{10}} = \frac{g_1}{g_0} e^{-E_{10}/k T_\mathrm{gas}}.
$$
In the limit that \(n_c \rightarrow \infty\) (i.e., collisions thermalize the gas), the steady state solution has us bring about the relationship
$$
\frac{n_1}{n_0} = \frac{g_1}{g_0} e^{-E_{10}/k T_\mathrm{gas}}.
$$&lt;/p>

\frac{d n_1}{d t} = n_0 \left [ n_c k_{01} + n_\gamma \frac{g_1}{g_0} A_{10} \right] - n_1 \left [ n_c k_{10} + (1 + n_\gamma) A_{10} \right]
$$
where we&amp;rsquo;ve written the absorption coefficient \(B_{01}\) in terms of \(A_{10}\) and canceled out some prefactors. We&amp;rsquo;ve also included stimulated emission in the rightmost term.&lt;/p>

\frac{n_1}{n_0} = \frac{n_c k_{01} + n_\gamma(g_1/g_0) A_{10}}{n_c k_{10} + (1 + n_\gamma) A_{10}}
$$
and examine for a few cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>in the limit that \(n_\gamma \rightarrow 0\), we have the previous result&lt;/li>
&lt;li>in the limit \(n_c \rightarrow 0\), and the radiation field is described by a blackbody field with \(T_\mathrm{rad}\), then the level populations are given by Boltzmann w/ that temperature (gas temperature could be different, though, it&amp;rsquo;s just that the number density of the collisional partners isn&amp;rsquo;t high enough to thermalize anything to the gas temperature).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>if the temperature of the radiation field happens to match that of the gas \(T_\mathrm{gas}\), then the system will be brought into equilibrium independent of the collisional density&lt;/li>

n_{\mathrm{crit}, u}(c) \equiv \frac{\sum_{l&amp;lt;u} [1 + (n_\gamma)&lt;em>{ul}] A&lt;/em>{ul}}{\sum_{u &amp;lt;l} k_{ul}(c)}
$$
i.e., we&amp;rsquo;re considering multi-level atoms and summing over all states \(l\) lower than the state under consideration (\(u\)).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a two-level atom, this is
$$
n_\mathrm{crit} = \frac{(1 + n_\gamma) A_{ul}}{k_{ul}}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This definition is appropriate only when the gas is optically thin such that the radiated photons escape. If it&amp;rsquo;s not, then we get &amp;ldquo;radiative trapping,&amp;rdquo; which we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss in a future lecture.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In the &lt;strong>high density regime&lt;/strong>, \(n \gg n_\mathrm{crit}\), the rate of collisional deexcitation is greater than radiative deexcitation, and the excitation temperature is driven towards the kinetic temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>In the &lt;strong>low density regime&lt;/strong> \(n &amp;lt; n_\mathrm{crit}\), the rate of collisional deexcitation is less than radiative deexcitation, and the excitation temperature is driven to the radiation temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We can expand this discussion a bit by following the example from &lt;a href="http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast871/Notes/Molecules.pdf">Richard Pogge&lt;/a> and discuss the specific example of a medium with two-level atoms (ratio of states given by \(T_\mathrm{exc}\), kinetic temperature given by \(T\)) with some &lt;em>blackbody&lt;/em> radiation field with radiation temperature \(T_\mathrm{rad}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the high density regime, we&amp;rsquo;ll have the excitation temperature driven towards the kinetic temperature \(T_\mathrm{exc} \rightarrow T\). If \(T &amp;gt; T_\mathrm{rad}\) (common in ISM), we&amp;rsquo;ll see an emission line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the low density regime, we&amp;rsquo;ll have the excitation temperature driven towards the radiation temperature \(T_\mathrm{exc} \rightarrow T_\mathrm{rad}\), in which case we won&amp;rsquo;t see a line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is why it is sometimes said that a medium needs to be above the critical density for a line to &amp;ldquo;turn on.&amp;rdquo; Different species have different critical densities, and so line strengths can be used as density diagnostics.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Ionization in Predominantly Neutral Regions (cool + warm HI regions)</title><link>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/14-ionization-neutral-regions/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/14-ionization-neutral-regions/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://psu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/Astro+542A+Lecture+Sep+29/1_z72pm38a">Zoom link&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>What is the degree of ionization expected in predominately neutral interstellar clouds?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>\(n_e\) determines ionization balance of various species&lt;/li>
&lt;li>collisions with free electrons play a role in determining the charge state for interstellar grains&lt;/li>
&lt;li>electrons play a role in interstellar chemistry and sometimes cool the gas via collisional excitation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Three main regimes to consider&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>diffuse H I regions&lt;/strong>: metals are photoionized by starlight; cosmic rays create a small amount of \(\mathrm{H}^+\) and \(\mathrm{He}^+\). The gas may be CNM or WNM.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>diffuse molecular clouds&lt;/strong>: (e.g., moderate visual extinction \(0.3 \lesssim A_V \lesssim 2\,\mathrm{mag}\)). Most hydrogen is in \(H_\mathrm{2}\), metals still predominately photoionized by starlight. Cosmic rays can produce \(H_2^+\), which leads to the formation of \(H_3^+\).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>dark molecular clouds&lt;/strong>: (e.g., visual extinction \(A_V \gtrsim 3\,\mathrm{mag}\)). Insufficient UV radiation to photoionize elements like C and S. CRs can maintain only a very small ionization \(10^{-7}\).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="ionization-of-metals-in-h-i-regions">Ionization of metals in H I regions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Carbon is the fourth most astrophysically abundant element.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Q&lt;/strong>: what&amp;rsquo;s the third?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A&lt;/strong>: oxygen&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Nearly 60% of the carbon in the ISM is in solid grains, leaving a gas phase abundance of \(n_C / n_H \approx 1 \times 10^{-4}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As we talked about in previous lectures, stellar photons with energies greater than \(I_H = 13.6\) eV cannot penetrate appreciable quantities of H I gas because the cross-section for photoionization is large. But, carbon has an ionization energy of 11.26 eV, which means that it can be ionized by starlight photons that &lt;em>will&lt;/em> penetrate H I. As a result, under typical ISM conditions, we find that 99% of the carbon is ionized.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ionization-of-hydrogen-in-cool-h-i-regions">Ionization of hydrogen in cool H I regions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Stellar photons with energies greater than \(I_H = 13.6\) eV cannot penetrate appreciable quantities of H I gas, however x-rays of sufficiently high energies can reach the interior of clouds. Let&amp;rsquo;s revisit the photoionization cross sections from Ch. 13 to see why this is the case:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="fig_13_1.jpg"
alt="Photoionization cross sections for hydrogen atoms, molecular hydrogen, helium, carbon, and oxygen. The cross sections are high when the photon energy is close to the ionization energy, zero when the photon is below this, and decline as a power law when photon energies are much higher.

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Still, we&amp;rsquo;re talking about ionization fractions of \(n_e \lesssim 0.01\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also need to consider cosmic ray flux.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="diffuse-molecular-gas">Diffuse molecular gas&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>\(0.3 \lesssim A_V \lesssim 2\,\mathrm{mag}\)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In regions where molecular hydrogen can be found, most ionizations produced by cosmic rays or x rays&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>detach an electron from \(H_\mathrm{2}\) to create \(\mathrm{H}^+\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>if it encounters an electron, the \(\mathrm{H}^+\) will dissociatively recombine
$$
\mathrm{H}_2^+ + e^- \rightarrow \mathrm{H} + \mathrm{H}
$$&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>But, since the electron fraction in molecular gas is low, it may not encounter an electron before it undergoes the fast exothermic ion-molecular reaction
$$
\mathrm{H}_2^+ + \mathrm{H}_2 \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_3^+ + \mathrm{H}
$$
to form
\(\mathrm{H}_3^+\), which will eventually dissociatively recombine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because all of these involve free electron densities, we can use the ratio of
$$
\frac{N(\mathrm{H}_3^+)}{N(\mathrm{H}_2^+)}
$$
to estimate the cosmic ray ionization rate in molecular clouds.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dense-molecular-clouds-dark-clouds">Dense Molecular Clouds (dark clouds)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When \(A_V \gtrsim 3\,\mathrm{mag}\), even carbon and sulfur remain predominately neutral. Most of the free electrons come from cosmic ray ionization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As before, CR ionization produces \(\mathrm{H}_2^+\), which leads to \(\mathrm{H}_3^+\). However, in dense molecular clouds the ionization fraction is so low that most of these \(\mathrm{H}_3^+\) ions react with atoms or molecules (like CO) to form a generic molecule (like \(HCO^+\)), which will then recombine dissociatively, capture an electron from a grain, or charge exchange with a neutral atom like sulfur.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The end result of these reactions, though, is that deep within a molecular cloud cosmic ray ionization is the only source of free electrons, and even then, the gas has a very low ionization fraction. This has bearing on the magnetohydrodynamics of the gas, because ionized gas interacts with a magnetic field, while neutral gas doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Photoionized Gas (HII regions)</title><link>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/13-photoionized-gas-hii/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/13-photoionized-gas-hii/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://psu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/Astro+542A+Lecture+Sep+27/1_7qvclhvh">Zoom link&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Recall ionization state from previous lecture
$$
x_e = \frac{n_e}{n_\mathrm{H}}.
$$
Note that here we are using \(n_\mathrm{H}\) as a marker for total number density of hydrogen, not just neutral hydrogen, i.e., \(n_\mathrm{H} = n_{\mathrm{H}^+} + n_{\mathrm{H}^0}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the warm ionized medium \(x_e \sim 0.7\) and in the hot ionized medium \(x_e \sim 1\). Recall from the Saha equation that ionization fraction is a function of temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There is the warm ionized medium (WIM) which is \(T \sim 8000\) K and \( n \approx 0.2\;\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\).
There are also H II regions and planetary nebulae (a denser analog to the WIM) that contain many diagnostic tools (in terms of emission) that allow us to determine densities, temperatures, compositions, and ionization states.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>first ionization energy&lt;/strong>: energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron from a neutral atom in its ground state. For hydrogen, this is 13.6 eV, for helium it&amp;rsquo;s 24.6 eV, for oxygen its 13.6 eV, for carbon its 11.3 eV, see R&amp;amp;P Table 1.2.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>question&lt;/em>: why do we usually care about the energy required to hydrogen, but don&amp;rsquo;t talk much about the ionization energy from the \(n=2\) level, which is \(I=3.40\) eV?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>answer&lt;/em>: in realistic interstellar situations, \(n=2\) rare to find a large population of \(n=2\) hydrogen atoms, and the spontaneous emission \(A_{21}^{-1} \sim 2\) nanoseconds is quick, so rare that we&amp;rsquo;d have an encounter while it is populated. It would sooner emit a Lyman \(\alpha\) photon. To gain a 50% population of \(n=2\) atoms relative to \(n=1\) in LTE, we&amp;rsquo;d need to be at about 50,000 K, but at these temperatures the hydrogen will already be pretty much fully ionized.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="photoionization-and-radiative-recombination">Photoionization and Radiative Recombination&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Photoionization occurs by photoelectric absorption:
$$
\mathrm{H} + h \nu \rightarrow p + e^-
$$
where the photon energy must be \(h \nu &amp;gt; I_\mathrm{H}\) where \(I_\mathrm{H} = 13.60\) eV (otherwise no ionization will occur).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Above this range, we have&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\sigma_\mathrm{photo}(\nu) \approx \sigma_0 \left (\frac{h\nu}{Z^2 I_\mathrm{H}} \right)^{-3}
$$&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;h3 id="photoionization-rate">Photoionization rate&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We can calculate \(\zeta_\mathrm{photo}\) the photoionization rate, or the rate at which a single neutral hydrogen atom undergoes photoionization.
$$
\zeta_\mathrm{photo} = \int_{\nu_0}^\infty \frac{\varepsilon_\nu}{h \nu} c \sigma_\mathrm{photo}(\nu)\,d\nu
$$
where \(\nu_0\) is the threshold ionization frequency and \(\varepsilon_\nu\) is the background energy density.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, the &lt;strong>volumetric photoionization rate&lt;/strong> is
$$
\frac{d n_\mathrm{H\,II}}{d t} = n_\mathrm{H\,I} \zeta_\mathrm{photo}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="recombination-rate">Recombination rate&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Radiative recombination is the inverse process to photoionization
$$
p + e^- \rightarrow H + h \nu.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The radiative recombination rate is \(\alpha\) (we&amp;rsquo;ve used a more convenient variable than \(\langle \sigma v \rangle\), but its the same idea), and it&amp;rsquo;s
$$
\alpha_{nl}(T) = \left (\frac{8 k T}{\pi m_e} \right)^{1/2} \int_0^\infty \sigma_{rr,nl}(E) \frac{E}{k T} e^{-E/k T} \frac{d E}{k T}
$$
and has units of \(\mathrm{cm}^3\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the &lt;strong>volumetric rate of radiative recombination&lt;/strong> is
$$
\frac{d n_\mathrm{H\,II}}{d t} = - n_e n_\mathrm{H\,II} \alpha.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To calculate \(\alpha_n\), you need to sum over all values of angular momentum quantum number \(l\). To calculate \(\alpha\), the total recombination rate, need to sum over principle quantum numbers \(n\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can calculate something called the recombination timescale
$$
t_\mathrm{rec} \equiv \frac{1}{\alpha n_e} \sim 0.6\;\mathrm{Myr}
$$
for H II to undergo radiative recombination. The timescale is typical for the warm ionized medium with \(T=8000\) K and \(n_e \sim 0.1\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In ionization equilibrium, we have
$$
n_\mathrm{H\,I} \zeta_\mathrm{photo} = n_e n_\mathrm{H\,II} \alpha.
$$&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Toy model&amp;rdquo; of an H II region. Assume we have &lt;em>pure atomic hydrogen gas&lt;/em> with uniform density \(n_\mathrm{H}\) that surrounds a central point source of light. What does the ionization fraction look like as a function of radius, as a function of time?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assume the central light source produces ionizing photons with \(h \nu &amp;gt; I_\mathrm{H}\) at a constant rate \(Q_0\) (i.e., photons/s). For a real O3 star with \(T_\mathrm{eff} \approx 45000\)K, \(Q_0 = 7.6\times10^{47}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Say we &amp;ldquo;turn on&amp;rdquo; the star at \(t=0\), the mean free path for ionizing photons traveling through the neutral medium is
$$
\lambda_\mathrm{mfp} = \frac{1}{n_\mathrm{H} \sigma_\mathrm{photo}} = 0.0014\,\mathrm{pc} \left ( \frac{n_\mathrm{H}}{40\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}} \right)^{-1} \left ( \frac{\sigma_\mathrm{photo}}{6 \times 10^{-18}\,\mathrm{cm}^2} \right )^{-1}
$$
scalings are for cold neutral medium and photon just above ionization energy.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="calculate-the-volume-of-ionized-gas">Calculate the volume of ionized gas&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Assume that every ionizing photon will ionize hydrogen (and just pass through ionized hydrogen),
$$
Q_0 = n_\mathrm{H} \frac{d V}{d t} = n_\mathrm{H} 4 \pi R^2 \frac{d R}{d t}
$$
which we can integrate and find that the radius increases like
$$
R(t) = \left( \frac{3 Q_0}{4 \pi n_\mathrm{H}} t \right)^{1/3}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have neglected the facts that&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>protons and electrons recombine at a rate proportional to \(\alpha n_e n_\mathrm{H\,II}\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>some UV photons from central source reionize atoms that recombined&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>which modifies the equation to
$$
Q_0 = n_\mathrm{H} 4 \pi R^2 \frac{d R}{d t} + \alpha_{B,H} n_e n_H \frac{4 \pi}{3} R^3
$$
or
$$
Q_0 = n_\mathrm{H} 4 \pi R^2 \frac{d R}{d t} + \alpha_{B,H} n_H^2 \frac{4 \pi}{3} R^3
$$
we have assume the ionized sphere to be optically thick to ionizing radiation (case B) an that the fractional ionization is \(x = 1\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can integrate this and obtain
$$
R(t) = R_S \left (1 - e^{-t/t_\mathrm{rec}} \right)^{1/3}
$$
where the Stromgren radius \(R_S\) is
$$
R_S \equiv \left (\frac{3 Q_0}{4 \pi \alpha_{B,H} n^2_H} \right)^{1/3} \approx 5.5\,\mathrm{pc}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can recalculate the recombination time assuming Case B and in a setup where we have a pure hydrogen H II region with fractional ionization \(x \approx 1\).
$$
t_\mathrm{rec} \approx \frac{1}{\alpha_{B, H} n_H} \approx 2600\,\mathrm{yr}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So it takes about 3000 years to create a Stromgren sphere.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At times \(t \gg t_\mathrm{rec}\), the Stromgren sphere will consist of a sphere of almost fully ionized gas with radius \(R \rightarrow R_S \sim 6\,\mathrm{pc}\). Outside of this, there will be a partially ionized boundary of thickness \(\lambda_\mathrm{mfp} \sim 0.001\,\mathrm{pc} \ll R_S\), and outside of this, neutral hydrogen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because radiative recombination is the reversal of photoionization, \(t_\mathrm{rec}\) is also the time it takes for the sphere to go back to neutral H after the central UV source has been turned off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Stromgren sphere approaches ionization temperature, but it&amp;rsquo;s still far from pressure equilibrium, and as it&amp;rsquo;s heated, it will begin to expand.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Interstellar Radiation Fields, Ionization Processes, and Recombination of Ions with Electrons</title><link>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/12-ionization-processes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/12-ionization-processes/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://psu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/Astro+542A+Lecture+Sep+24/1_v7exn76l">Zoom link&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Pick a point in our galaxy, somewhere in the ISM. Look around. Unless you are deep in a molecular cloud, it isn&amp;rsquo;t completely dark.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, the intensity of the incoming radiation very much depends on your &lt;em>location&lt;/em> in the Galaxy and &lt;em>where&lt;/em> you&amp;rsquo;re looking. Remember, \(I_\nu\) is a function of &lt;em>position&lt;/em> \(\vec{x}\) and &lt;em>direction&lt;/em> \(\Omega\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re very near an H II region, or partially shielded by a molecular cloud, etc&amp;hellip; you will see a different spectrum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first part of this lecture is looking at the spectral energy distribution of the interstellar radiation field in a roughly &amp;ldquo;average&amp;rdquo; sense.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In our solar neighborhood, from lowest frequency to highest, we are dominated by&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Galactic synchrotron&lt;/strong> from relativistic electrons in the galactic magnetic field. Dominates at \(\nu &amp;lt; 1\) GHz. Spatially variable, enhanced near SNe remnants. You can measure the sky-averaged antenna temperature from synchrotron and you&amp;rsquo;ll find
$$
\langle T_A \rangle \approx 700\,\mathrm{K}
$$
at \(\nu = 140\) MHz, meaning that the radio sky (at low frequencies) is &lt;em>very&lt;/em> bright. But, the total energy density (integrated over relevant frequencies) is comparably small.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CMB&lt;/strong> at \(\nu=1\) GHz, the CMB exceeds the synchrotron. \(T_\mathrm{CMB} = 2.7255\), essentially isotropic, with the primary departure from the dipole perturbation of the motion of the Sun relative to CMB rest-frame.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Far-infrared (FIR) and infrared (IR)&lt;/strong> emission from dust grains heated by starlight. Dominates between wavelengths of 600 microns up to 5 microns. Most of the spectrum can be approximated as thermal emission from dust grains at a temperature of 17 K. The remaining part is (wavelengths shorter than 50 microns) is power radiated by vibrational emission bands, likely from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) particles&lt;/li>

&lt;li>&lt;strong>Starlight&lt;/strong>, i.e., photons from stellar photospheres. At optical wavelengths, most photons are starlight. Local starlight background is the sum of diffuse blackbodies. Within an H I region, very little radiation at UV and FUV wavelengths (see super shop dropoff), because this radiation is strongly absorbed by neutral H and He. This type of radiation is very important for photoexciting \(\mathrm{H}_2\) and other molecules, photoionizing heavy elements, and ejecting photons from dust grains. The UV radiation is very spatially variable, because the O and B stars that are the primary emitters of this radiation are sporadic and clumped together in star forming regions.&lt;/li>

Most of this from SNe, injecting energy into the ISM, energy goes into thermal plasma, and then re-radiated as x-rays and extreme UV. Lower energies easily absorbed by neutral H I, so at the boundary between this and the starlight regions, the radiation density is highly variable. In external galaxies, AGN can make this part of energy density much higher.&lt;/li>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>radiative recombination&lt;/strong>
$$
X^+ + e^- \rightarrow X + h \nu
$$
If recombination takes place such that the electron goes straight to the ground state, then the photon that is emitted can ionize hydrogen. If the region has a significant population of neutral hydrogen, then the emitted photon will have a high probability of being absorbed close to where it was emitted. This sets up two &amp;ldquo;regimes&amp;rdquo; of recombination,
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Case A&lt;/strong>: the region is &lt;em>optically thin&lt;/em> to ionizing radiation, such that every ionizing photon emitted during the process escapes. Happens in collisionally ionized regions that are very hot (and very low density)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Case B&lt;/strong>: the region is &lt;em>optically thick&lt;/em> to ionizing radiation, such that ionizing photons emitted are immediately absorbed. The recombinations directly to the ground state do not change the ionization of the gas, only recombinations to states \(n \geq 2\) do. Happens in photoionized nebulae around O and B stars, aka H II regions&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The hydrogen recombination emission spectrum can be calculated from the radiative decays from one level to one or more lower levels. Radiative recombination creates neutral atoms with excited levels, which will then (quickly) decay to other lower levels, producing a characteristic line-emission spectrum.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the ratios of these lines can be measured and used to calculate the temperature of the region&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the total power from the lines can be used to determine total rate of hydrogen recombination&lt;/li>
&lt;li>relative intensities of recombination lines can be used to estimate dust reddening&lt;/li>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>By comparison to optical windows, the radio region of the spectrum is downright transparent. Only towards very high radio/microwave frequencies (wavelengths about 1 mm), does the atmospheric transmission start to decline.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The same
$$
\theta \approx \frac{\lambda}{D}
$$
applies for radio antennas. Take a \(\lambda = 1\;\mathrm{cm}\) observation, for example. Compared to an optical \(\lambda = 500\;\mathrm{nm}\) telescope the same size, the resolution will be a factor of
$$
\frac{1\;\mathrm{cm}}{500\;\mathrm{nm}} = 20,000
$$
worse. Yikes!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Radio astronomers are constantly trying to find ways to increase angular (spatial) resolution.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>One way is to build bigger telescopes, such as the Green Bank Telescope (100m diameter)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="https://public.nrao.edu/gallery/green-bank-telescope/">&lt;img src="gbt.jpg"

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Another way is to work at higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths), e.g. sub-mm radio astronomy (IRAM 30m telescope)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="https://www.iram-institute.org/EN/30-meter-telescope.php">&lt;img src="iram.jpg"

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A final way is to use &lt;em>interferometry&lt;/em>, sometimes also at sub-mm wavelengths (ALMA)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="alma.jpg"
alt="The Atacama Large (Sub)millimeter Array, an interferometric array of 66 antennas operating at sub-millimeter wavelengths.

Credit: NRAO/ESO/NAOJ/JAO&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s easier to build larger telescopes at longer wavelengths because the tolerances required for the reflecting surface are less strict than at optical wavelengths. Though typically one must keep surface tolerances to within
$$
\sigma = \frac{\lambda_\mathrm{min}}{16},
$$
otherwise the efficiency of the antenna starts to decline substantially. For the 100 m diameter GBT operating at it&amp;rsquo;s highest frequency (100 GHz) or 3 mm, this translates to \(200\;\mu\mathrm{m}\), which is the thickness of two sheets of paper! That&amp;rsquo;s quite an engineering challenge, and is the reason why large, steerable dishes are difficult to build.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Keeping telescopes fixed is one way to build a little bit bigger, such as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-hundred-meter_Aperture_Spherical_Telescope">FAST&lt;/a>, which is a five hundred meter diameter fixed telescope in China. See also Arecibo, which unfortunately collapsed in December 2020. Eventually, though, the materials/engineering cost to building large single dish telescopes becomes prohibitive.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="single-dish-observations">Single dish observations&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;beam&amp;rdquo; or power pattern as a function of direction, of a receiving antenna can be calculated using the reciprocity theorems for transmitting and receiving antennas. We don&amp;rsquo;t have time to cover it in this lecture, but the end result is that the far field electric field pattern \(f(l)\) is the Fourier transform of the electric field illuminating the aperture of the telescope \(g(u)\).&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;a href="https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~sransom/web/Ch3.html#S1">&lt;img src="uniform-dish.png"

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>For large apertures, the nulls at \( l = \pm 1, 2, \ldots\) appear at the angles \(\theta \approx \lambda/D, 2 \lambda/D, \ldots\). In two dimensions, for a circular aperture, this is an Airy pattern.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This is an idealized representation, but is still helpful. The beam can pick up power through sidelobes at a range of angles. Directional antennas help concentrate power in the main beam, but antennas with secondary stages (and thus supports, like most telescopes) create opportunities for ground radiation to reflect into the receiver. The relationship between the aperture and the electric&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can think of single-dish telescopes (unless they have a sophisticated, multi-pixel receiver) essentially as single-pixel devices. So to make a map of the sky, you would need to raster scan the telescope across the region of interest, reading out antenna temperature as a function of RA, Dec. To make a good (i.e., scientifically accurate) map, you should focus on Nyquist sampling the sky to a uniform sensitivity, usually through a hexagonal pattern of dithering. More advanced instruments may have an array of &amp;ldquo;feeds&amp;rdquo; in a focal plane (mirroring a set of &amp;ldquo;pixels&amp;rdquo;), but this is still a small number of pixels compared to a typical CCD (e.g., 25 or 36).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="temperatures-redux">Temperatures, redux&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In an earlier lecture, we gave definitions of &amp;ldquo;brightness temperature&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;antenna temperature&amp;rdquo; following Draine&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>brightness temperature&lt;/strong>: the temperature corresponding to the specific intensity if we used the full form of the Planck formula&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>antenna temperature&lt;/strong>: the temperature corresponding to the specific intensity if we were in the Rayleigh-Jeans domain. Added benefit that specific intensity is &lt;em>linearly related&lt;/em> to antenna temperature and makes it easy to substitute one for the other.
$$
T_A(\nu) = \frac{c^2}{2 k \nu^2} I_\nu
$$&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These definitions are still true, but also somewhat idealized, as we&amp;rsquo;ll cover in a second.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the field of radio astronomy, be aware that one frequently combines temperatures in other interesting ways. One can express random noise power in terms of an effective temperature
$$
P = k T \Delta \nu
$$
where \(\Delta \nu\) is the bandwidth of the observation. Here the power is equal to the noise power delivered to a &lt;strong>matched load&lt;/strong> by a resistor at physical temperature \(T\). By matched load, we mean we connect a resistor to the input terminals of a linear amplifier. The fact that this resistor has some temperature (i.e., we haven&amp;rsquo;t cooled it to absolute zero&amp;hellip;) means that the thermal motion of the electrons will produce a random, variable current \(i(t)\) input to the amplifier. The mean value of this current is zero, but the root mean squared value is non-zero, and this represents a non-zero power. I.e., you can draw (some) power from a resistor at room temperature, purely from thermal motions. The situation is not dissimilar to the random walk of a particle in Brownian motion. For more details, see &lt;em>Tools of Radio Astronomy&lt;/em>, Chapter 1.8.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Antenna temperature&lt;/strong> \(T_A\) the component of the power received by the antenna from &lt;em>cosmic sources&lt;/em>. It has the same interpretation as before (though we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about beam dilution in a second).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Receiver temperature&lt;/strong> \(T_R\) the component of the power from internal noise of the receiver components themselves, ground radiation, atmospheric emission, etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>System temperature&lt;/strong> \(T_S = T_A + T_R\) is the sum of receiver temperature and antenna temperature. It&amp;rsquo;s the one power number coming out of the backend of your telescope. It&amp;rsquo;s up to you to calibrate \(T_R\) accurately enough to measure \(T_A\).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In any observation, you will have your cosmic signal of interest and several contributions of noise (see &lt;em>Essential Radio Astronomy&lt;/em>, Ch. 3.6.1)
$$
T_S=T_\mathrm{cmb}+T_\mathrm{rsb}+T_A + [1−\exp(−\tau_A)] T_\mathrm{atm}+T_\mathrm{spill}+T_r+ \ldots
$$
such as the CMB, other galactic background sources, the atmosphere, spillover radiation from the ground, the temperature of the radiometer itself (hopefully cryogenically cooled), etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the limit that \(T_A \ll T_S\) (most astronomy situations, unfortunately!), we have
$$
S/N \approx C \frac{T_A}{T_S} \sqrt{\Delta \nu \Delta t}
$$
where \(C\) is a constant of proportionality greater than or equal to 1, and \(\Delta t\) is the integration time. If we let \(\Delta \nu \approx 1\;\mathrm{GHz}\) and \(\Delta t \approx 1\;\mathrm{h}\), then we can get \(\sqrt{\Delta \nu \Delta t} \approx 10^6\), allowing us to detect a signal which is less than \(10^{-6}\) the system noise. A great illustration of this capability is the COBE satellite that studied CMB anisotropies with brightness temperatures \(&amp;lt; 10^{-7}\) that of the system temperature. To achieve these contrasts, however, it&amp;rsquo;s important to keep systematics under control, otherwise the S/N scaling won&amp;rsquo;t hold!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="beam-dilution">Beam dilution&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In previous lectures, we&amp;rsquo;ve been talking about specific intensity \(I_\nu(\Omega)\) as a &amp;ldquo;known&amp;rdquo; quantity of direction (e.g., R.A., Dec.) and used antenna temperature \(T_A\) as a linear proxy for its specification. For the following discussion, we&amp;rsquo;re going to move into the realm of observations, and discuss the ways \(T_A\) can be an unfaithful proxy for the &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; specific intensity distribution or brightness temperature. we&amp;rsquo;ll use the symbol \(T_b(\Omega)\) to denote the &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; brightness/antenna temperature, assuming we&amp;rsquo;re in the Rayleigh-Jeans limit, and redefine \(T_A\) to mean the response of the telescope to the cosmic radiation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we&amp;rsquo;re doing observations, we don&amp;rsquo;t always have access to the highest resolution version of \(T_b(\Omega)\), but rather we have access to a quantity which is the true \(T_b(\Omega)\) convolved with the beam of the telescope, which is the implication of \(T_A\) for this discussion.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="large-fully-resolved-source">large (fully resolved) source&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>[Draw a smooth cloud with the beam overlaid as a small circle].&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the limit that we are observing a source that subtends a solid angle much larger than the beam of the antenna,
$$
\Omega_S &amp;gt; \Omega_A
$$
the convolution of the beam doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter, we&amp;rsquo;re still sensing approximately the same \(T_b(\Omega)\) such that
$$
T_A(\Omega) \approx T_b(\Omega).
$$
If the source is in LTE, then we also have that \(T_A \approx T\).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="small-unresolved-source">small (unresolved) source&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>[Draw a beam with a smaller source in the center]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the source is more compact than the antenna beam,
$$
\Omega_S &amp;lt; \Omega_A,
$$
then the measured antenna temperature is basically the &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; intensity averaged over the area of the main beam. This lowers the measured antenna temperature by a factor
$$
\frac{T_A}{T_b} = \frac{\Omega_S}{\Omega_A}
$$
where the ratio \(\frac{\Omega_S}{\Omega_A}\) is called the &lt;strong>beam filling factor&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, you could have a compact source with \(T_b = 10^4\) K, but if it only fills 1% of the beam solid angle then you would measure an antenna temperature of 100 K. If you took your observations at face-value (and assumed LTE), then you would incorrectly conclude that the source is 100x cooler than it actually is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beam dilution also applies to observations of sources that have &lt;em>structure&lt;/em> on spatial scales below the observable limit, which, to be honest, is going to be most astrophysical sources of interest. For example, consider a gas filament in a star-forming region.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[Draw an approximation of a gas filament]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Radio-bright, spatially concentrated regions will be &amp;ldquo;smeared out&amp;rdquo; by the beam. If you wanted to use antenna temperature (and assume LTE) to estimate the physical conditions of the gas filament, you do so at the peril of measuring incorrect temperatures. The unfortunate reality here is that, without higher resolution images to guide you (which sometimes exist at optical or infrared wavelengths), it&amp;rsquo;s quite difficult to estimate how badly your measurements are affected by beam dilution.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="point-source">point source&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In the case of an unresolved &lt;em>point source&lt;/em> with known flux \(F_\nu\), it&amp;rsquo;s not that helpful to talk about brightness temperatures if we can&amp;rsquo;t also estimate the solid angle that the source subtends \(\Omega_S\), since it is required to relate flux to specific intensity (or brightness temperature). [Sometimes we &lt;em>can&lt;/em> estimate \(\Omega_S\) from theoretical arguments, even if the source is so small as to still be unresolvable, in which case we&amp;rsquo;d still use the above calculations.]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For point sources, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to talk about antenna temperature using
$$
T_A = \frac{P_\nu}{k} = \frac{A_e F_\nu}{2 k}
$$
where \(A_e\) is the effective collecting area of the telescope. This gives us the strange but sometimes convenient relationship of talking about a telescope&amp;rsquo;s sensitivity to a point source using &amp;ldquo;kelvins per jansky,&amp;rdquo; which is proportional to its collecting area.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more useful single-dish guidance, see &lt;a href="https://www.atnf.csiro.au/research/radio-school/2011/talks/Parkes-school-Fundamental-II.pdf">these notes&lt;/a> by James Jackson, or &lt;a href="https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~sransom/web/Ch3.html#S1.SS6">Ch 3.1.6&lt;/a> of &lt;em>Essential Radio Astronomy&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="two-element-interferometer">Two-element interferometer&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll focus our discussion around the two-element interferometer, since even arrays of antennas (like ALMA) can be understood by breaking them down (conceptually) into this fundamental unit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider two antennas separated by some distance \(b\) simultaneously observing a source. Unless the source is directly overhead, the radiation from the source will arrive at the antennas at slightly different times, corresponding to a geometric time delay \(\tau_g\). The voltage streams from these two antennas \(V_1\) and \(V_2\) are then &lt;strong>correlated&lt;/strong> (multiplied together and then averaged) to form the output stream \(R\).&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>For now, we&amp;rsquo;ll call this a &lt;em>cosine&lt;/em> correlator because of the cosine dependence of the correlation stream.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The fringe pattern in the lower right of this figure is what you would get if you kept the antennas stationary and let a point source drift across the field of view. The broad envelope is the attenuation from the primary beam response of the antennas as the source enters and then leaves the field of view. The fringe frequency depends on the observing frequency and the baseline separating the antennas.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interestingly, the time averaged response of a multiplying interferometer has a mean of 0. This has the consequence that uncorrelated noise power from very extended sources (such as the CMB) will average to 0, therefore, the interferometer is not sensitive to radiation on those large spatial scales. This is called &lt;em>spatial filtering&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="multiple-antennas">Multiple antennas&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>With multiple pairs of antennas, we can build up an improved point source response, because the fringe patterns of the individual two-element interferometers add up.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>In the limit of many antennas, the beam usually looks like something centralized, approximately Gaussian, but usually containing many sidelobes (hence, why radio astronomers call this a &amp;ldquo;dirty beam&amp;rdquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The resolution of the beam is on the order of \(\lambda/b\), where \(b\) is the projected baseline of the longest antenna pair. Note that this resolution strongly depends on the relative number of baselines at long/short separations. It won&amp;rsquo;t suffice to just have a single long-baseline pair of antennas if most other antenna pairs are at much shorter baselines.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="complex-correlators">Complex correlators&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Now let&amp;rsquo;s move beyond a discussion of point sources and consider what we&amp;rsquo;ll call a &amp;ldquo;slightly extended source,&amp;rdquo; something that is larger than the dirty beam but smaller than the primary beam of each telescope.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instantaneous field of view of an interferometer is the same as the primary beam of each telescope, treated as a single dish (see previous section). Each single dish antenna is still seeing the same thing as before, it&amp;rsquo;s just that we have a correlator backend that&amp;rsquo;s doing things with the signals, allowing us to place many &lt;em>synthesized beams&lt;/em> within the area of the primary beam.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The cosine correlator we discussed has some limitations, namely that the quantity
$$
R_c = \int I(\hat{s}) \cos(2 \pi \vec{b} \cdot \hat{s}/\lambda) d\Omega
$$
term is only sensitive to the &lt;em>even&lt;/em> (symmetric) component of a source.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[Draw cosine curve centered around \(\vec{b} \cdot \hat{s} = 0 \), show that there is ambiguity in the response.]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can decompose any function into a sum of its even and odd (antisymmetric) parts. To capture the &lt;em>odd&lt;/em> parts of the source, we need a different kind of correlation,
$$
R_s = \int I(\hat{s}) \sin(2 \pi \vec{b} \cdot \hat{s}/\lambda) d\Omega
$$
which can be obtained by inserting a \(\pi/2 = 90^\circ\) phase delay in the output of one antenna.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we combine cosine and sine correlators (in hardware, this is all the same system), we have what is called a &lt;em>complex correlator&lt;/em>. It is usually more convenient to treat the cosine and sine components simultaneously using Euler&amp;rsquo;s formula and we have
$$
\mathcal{V} = R_c - i R_s
$$
or
$$
\mathcal{V} = \int I(\hat{s}) \exp(- i 2 \pi \vec{b} \cdot \hat{s}/\lambda) d\Omega.
$$
The quantity \(\mathcal{V}\) is called the &lt;em>visibility&lt;/em> and it is a complex number. It is the fundamental data product from an interferometer, and, like all data, it is usually measured with some noise. For more on this, see the &lt;a href="https://mpol-dev.github.io/MPoL/rml_intro.html">MPoL notes on likelihood functions&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="coordinates">Coordinates&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The equation we&amp;rsquo;ve just derived is fairly general, but let&amp;rsquo;s expand this a bit to the astronomical coordinate systems we&amp;rsquo;re more used to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rather than referring to the source brightness distribution with \(I_\nu(\hat{s})\), usually we&amp;rsquo;ll refer to some &lt;em>phase center&lt;/em>. [Typically this is the direction the antennas are pointed (i.e., center of primary beam), but doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to be and can be changed after the fact in software.]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can define the direction cosines in a tangent plane, such that we have \(l = \sin(\Delta \alpha \cos \delta)\) and \(m = \sin(\Delta \delta)\), where \(\alpha\) and \(\delta\) are R.A. and Dec., respectively.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>We can rewrite the projected baseline in terms of its east-west \(u\) and north-south \(v\) components, where&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
u = \left [ \frac{\vec{b} \cdot \hat{s}}{\lambda} \right ]_\mathrm{east-west}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
v = \left [ \frac{\vec{b} \cdot \hat{s}}{\lambda} \right ]_\mathrm{north-south}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we have that the image domain coordinates \(l, m\) have corresponding Fourier plane coordinates \(u, v\), called spatial frequencies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And the relationship between source brightness distribution and the visibility function is given by
$$
\mathcal{V}(u,v) = \int \int I(l,m) \exp \{ - 2 \pi i (ul + vm)\} dl dm.
$$
This is a two-dimensional Fourier transform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It turns out that the measured spatial frequencies correspond directly to the projected baseline vector lengths, if the baseline is measured in multiples of the observing frequency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Longer baselines measure higher spatial frequencies, which correspond to finer-scale image plane features.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="fourier-transform-pairs">Fourier Transform pairs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Here are some examples of Fourier transform pairs, where the left column represents the sky-plane intensity distribution \(I(l,m)\) and the right column represents the amplitude of the visibility function, \(|\mathcal{V}|^2\). (Remember, the visibility is a complex quantity, and also has a phase. Alternatively, it can be expressed in terms of its real and imaginary components.)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Because the earth rotates, the projected baseline to a source also changes throughout an observation. This can be used to great advantage to sample different spatial frequencies than were otherwise possible in a &amp;ldquo;snapshot&amp;rdquo; observation. The following is a video showing how UV coverage for the MAPS large program is built up over a series of eight 1-hour long observations, spaced out over a single year, and the corresponding &amp;ldquo;dirty beam&amp;rdquo; that results.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="making-images-from-visibilities">Making images from visibilities&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>How do go from the interferometric data samples of the visibility function to images? This is a complicated question.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We sampled the visibility function
$$
\mathcal{V}(u,v) = \int \int I(l,m) \exp \{ - 2 \pi i (ul + vm)\} dl dm.
$$
at a bunch of \(u,v\) points corresponding to the projected baselines of the array. There are many \(u,v\) points &lt;em>that we didn&amp;rsquo;t sample&lt;/em>, and so it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to carry out the inverse Fourier transform completely accurately, with data alone.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What can we do?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>One approach is to not make images, and instead forward-model your data using a parametric model, like you might fit a line to a bunch of points. These are complex numbers, but the same principle applies. This has the benefit that you can do Bayesian inference on the parameters of the model (e.g., a Gaussian with some width at some location, etc&amp;hellip;) but the drawback that you need to specify said model. For more information, see the discussion of model-fitting section of the &lt;a href="https://mpol-dev.github.io/MPoL/rml_intro.html">MPoL documentation&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Another is to fearlessly charge on and just take the direct inverse Fourier transform of the samples. This generates an image called the &amp;ldquo;dirty image,&amp;rdquo; because it retains the features of the dirty beam. The assumption here is that the unsampled spatial frequencies carry zero power (not a great assumption, in general), and their visibility values are set to zero. This means that the dirty image is highly sensitive to the array configuration, not something we want! The following movie shows the dirty image that results from choosing a different 75% of the dataset in a round robin fashion for each frame. There is no noise&amp;mdash;each visibility is sampled perfectly.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>&lt;/p>
&lt;/video>
&lt;p>There are several algorithms one can employ to try to recover the &amp;ldquo;true&amp;rdquo; sky brightness from the dirty image.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>CLEAN: iterative image-plane deconvolution. Build up a &amp;ldquo;CLEAN Model&amp;rdquo; using point sources, restore it with a &amp;ldquo;CLEAN beam,&amp;rdquo; which is typically a Gaussian.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Regularized Maximum Likelihood (RML) imaging: forward-modeling of the visibilities (e.g., &lt;a href="https://mpol-dev.github.io/MPoL/">MPoL&lt;/a>). Need to specify prior distributions in addition to the aforementioned visibility likelihood.&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="propagation-of-radio-waves-through-ism">Propagation of Radio Waves through ISM&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Propagating radio waves interact with the plasma particles, and therefore, the velocity of the wave propagation is &lt;em>slower&lt;/em> than would be the case in a vacuum. I.e., the speed of light is slower when it has to move through stuff!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this lecture, we&amp;rsquo;ll discuss how to calculate the &lt;strong>dispersion measure&lt;/strong> and the &lt;strong>rotation measure&lt;/strong> of electromagnetic radiation propagating through the ISM, and then how to use them to learn about the properties of the intervening ISM.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dispersion-relation-for-cold-plasmas">Dispersion relation for cold plasmas&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Let wavenumber be
$$
k = \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda},
$$
and angular frequency be related to linear frequency by
$$
\nu = \frac{\omega}{2\pi}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Electromagnetic waves propagating through a cold plasma with electron density \(n_e\) must satisfy the dispersion relation
$$
k^2 c^2 = \omega^2 - \omega_p
$$
where
$$
\omega_p = \left ( \frac{4 \pi n_e e^2}{m_e} \right)^{1/2} = 5.641 \times 10^4 \sqrt{\frac{n_e}{\mathrm{cm}^{-3}}} \; \mathrm{s}^{-1}
$$
is the plasma frequency. If we&amp;rsquo;re in a vacuum, no dispersion!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s something called the &lt;strong>phase velocity&lt;/strong>, which is the propagation of the surface of constant phase:
$$
v_\mathrm{phase} = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{c}{\sqrt{1 - (\omega_p/\omega)^2)}} &amp;gt; c
$$
Confusingly, this velocity &lt;em>can&lt;/em> be faster than the speed of light! &lt;em>But&lt;/em> this is just a &amp;ldquo;mirage&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;these don&amp;rsquo;t carry any energy. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_velocity">Wikipedia&lt;/a> helps with the visualizations here a lot. They are important for considering polarization, as we&amp;rsquo;ll see with Faraday rotation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are more concerned with the &lt;strong>group velocity&lt;/strong>
$$
v_g(\omega) = \frac{d \omega}{d k}
$$
which, in a plasma, is
$$
v_g = c \left ( 1 - \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2} \right)^{1/2}.
$$
The group velocity is the speed at which information (energy) can be transmitted, and indeed, \(v_g &amp;lt; c\).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dispersion-measure">Dispersion Measure&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Time delay of radiation as a function of frequency depends on intervening electron density&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now let&amp;rsquo;s consider some astronomical object that can emit a well-defined pulse of radiation, like a pulsar. Let \(L\) be the distance to the pulsar, and assume that \(t=0\) corresponds to the time of emission. &lt;em>As a function of frequency, what is the arrival time of the emission?&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s break the path up into small segments, each with length \(dL\). Using the group velocity for a given frequency, how long does it take radiation of that frequency to traverse \(dL\)? Since velocity is distance over time, we can just divide \(dL\) by the group velocity to get \(dt\)
$$
dt = \frac{dL}{v_g(\omega)}
$$
and
$$
t_\mathrm{arrival} = \int_0^L \frac{dL}{v_g(\omega)}
$$
We can plug in \(v_g(\omega)\), but then we get a tricky term denominator. Let&amp;rsquo;s do a Taylor expansion of \(f(\omega) = 1/v_g(\omega)\) around \(\omega\), and see if we can arrive at an expression that is friendlier to integrate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To first order, the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor series&lt;/a> expanded around \(x=a\) will look like
$$
f(x) \approx f(a) + f^\prime(a)(x - a).
$$
This is just a constant plus a linear term (draw a graph). One of the assumptions behind an accurate Taylor expansion is that the perturbation away from the reference point \(a\) is small. To ensure this, we can rewrite \(f(\omega)\) as
$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{c}(1 - x^2)^{-1/2}
$$
where \(x = \omega_p / \omega\). From the previous discussion around plasma frequency, we already pointed out that \(0 \lesssim x \ll 1\), so we will Taylor expand in terms of \(x\) about the point \(a = 0 \), and then resubstitute in for \(x\). This yields
$$
f(\omega) \approx \frac{1}{c} \left ( 1 + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}\right)
$$
and allows us to rephrase the integral as
$$
t_\mathrm{arrival} = \int_0^L \frac{dL}{c} \left ( 1 + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2}\right)
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
t_\mathrm{arrival} = \frac{L}{c} + \frac{1}{2 c \omega^2} \int_0^L \omega_p^2 d L.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s rewrite the plasma frequency \(\omega_p\) in terms of the electron density \(n_e\), and define the &lt;strong>dispersion measure&lt;/strong> to be
$$
DM = \int_0^L n_e d L
$$
such that we have
$$
t_\mathrm{arrival} = \frac{L}{c} + \frac{e^2}{2 \pi m_e c} \frac{1}{\nu^2} DM
$$
or, evaluating the constants,
$$
t_\mathrm{arrival} = \frac{L}{c} + 4.146\times10^{-3} \left ( \frac{\nu}{\mathrm{GHz}} \right)^{-2} \frac{DM}{\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\;\mathrm{pc}}\;\mathrm{s}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A typical DM for a pulsar 3 kpc away might be \(DM \approx 10^2\;\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\;\mathrm{pc} \), which, at an observing frequency of 1 GHz, would yield a delay of 0.4 s after traveling \(10^4\) years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On it&amp;rsquo;s own, this isn&amp;rsquo;t very useful to us, because we don&amp;rsquo;t know when \(t=0\) was. But what we can exploit is the &lt;em>frequency dependence&lt;/em> of the arrival time, \(t_\mathrm{arrival} \propto \mathrm{const} + \nu^{-2}\). This means that &lt;em>lower frequencies arrive later&lt;/em>, such that the pulse is &amp;ldquo;dispersed.&amp;rdquo; We can compare the relative arrival times and compare this to
$$
\frac{d t_\mathrm{arrival}}{d \nu} = - \frac{e^2}{\pi m_e c\nu^3} DM
$$
calculate the DM and thus the integrated electron density.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you do this for many hundreds of pulsars, and you have reasonable estimates of their \(L\) from other data, then you can build up a 3D model of the electron density of the galaxy, probed by these pencil beam measurements.

&lt;li>polarization of light depends on the the presence of a magnetic field along intervening line of sight&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Define the cyclotron frequency
$$
\omega_B = \frac{e B_{||}}{m_e c}
$$
where \( B_{||}\) is the component of the magnetic field &lt;em>parallel&lt;/em> to the direction of propagation. The dispersion relation for circularly polarized waves in cold plasma is
$$
k^2 c^2 = \omega^2 - \frac{\omega_p^2}{1 \pm \frac{\omega_B}{\omega}}
$$
where the \(\pm\) applies to right/left circular polarization. When we calculate the phase velocity (using similar Taylor expansion tricks for \(\omega_B / \omega \ll 1\) and \(\omega_p / \omega \ll 1\)), we see
$$
v_\mathrm{phase}(\omega) = \frac{\omega}{k(\omega)} \approx c \left [ 1 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2} \mp \frac{1}{2}\frac{\omega_p^2 \omega_B}{\omega^3} \right].
$$
What&amp;rsquo;s interesting about this is that the right/left circular polarization modes differ in phase velocity and wavenumber
$$
v_{\mathrm{phase},L} - v_{\mathrm{phase},R} = \frac{4 \pi e^3}{m_e^2} \frac{n_e B_{||}}{\omega^3}.
$$
and
$$
\Delta k = k_R - k_L = \frac{4 \pi e^3}{m_e^2 c^2} \frac{n_e B_{||}}{\omega^2}
$$
You can decompose even pure &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_polarization">linear polarization&lt;/a> into equal amounts of left and right &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_polarization">circular polarized light&lt;/a>. If the light propagates through a magnetized plasma, it will have its modes propagate at different phase velocities, which means after propagating some distance \(L\), the two waves will differ in phase by \(L \Delta k\).&lt;/p>

I.e., the rotation measure is the integral of the electron density &lt;em>times&lt;/em> the parallel component of the magnetic field along the line of sight. In analogy to the dispersion measure, we don&amp;rsquo;t know the starting point of the linear polarization angle, but, because the change in rotation angle is wavelength-dependent, by measureing the linear polarization angles at two different wavelengths \(\lambda_1\) and \(\lambda_2\), we can calculate the rotation measure
$$
RM = \frac{\Phi_2 - \Phi_1}{\lambda_2^2 - \lambda_1^2}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If you measure &lt;em>both&lt;/em> the RM and DM, you can put them together to calculate the electron density-weighted mean value of the line of sight magnetic field
$$
\langle B_{||} \rangle = \frac{2 \pi m_e^2 c^4}{e^3} \frac{RM}{DM}.
$$
Background sources like AGNs and pulsars are good for this type of calculation because they are in general strongly linearly polarized (from synchrotron radiation). Putting this together for many sightlines, Han et al. 2006 concludes magnetic field in Galactic disk follows spiral structure, but reverses direction from spiral arms to interarm regions.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A &lt;strong>thermal plasma&lt;/strong> is a partially ionized gas, whose particles have a velocity distribution that are very close to Maxwellian. We see these in interstellar space, with temperatures \(T = 10^3 - 10^8\) K. Generally, we can treat the plasma as in LTE.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note, though, that in the following discussion &amp;ldquo;continuum&amp;rdquo; does not necessarily mean blackbody, it just means that the opacity of the transition is much broader in frequency than a spectral line transition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three important emission mechanisms in plasmas&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Free-free&lt;/strong> transitions: an electron is inelastically scattered from one free state to another, emitting a continuum photon&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Free-bound&lt;/strong> transitions: an electron is initally free, but is captured into a bound state, emitting a continuum photon&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Bound-bound&lt;/strong> transitions: an electron makes a transition from one bound state to another, which the change in energy carried away by one or two photons&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Today we are discussing 1 and 2. 3 will be discussed the following week in lectures on &amp;ldquo;Recombination of Ions with Electrons&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Collisional Excitation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="free-free-emission-bremsstrahlung">Free-Free emission (Bremsstrahlung)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Braking radiation&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>Classical electromagnetism&lt;/em>: an accelerating charge radiates electromagnetic energy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>in a thermal plasma (remember, hot &amp;amp; partially ionized), electrons and ions are scattering off of one another&lt;/li>
&lt;li>because the electrons are much lighter than the ions, they undergo larger accelerations and dominate the radiation&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Provides continuum emission from radio frequencies up to the point where the photon energies are comparable to the thermal energy \(k T\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See Rybicki and Lightman Ch 5: Bremsstrahlung for more details on the derivation of the emissivity of this mechanism. Here, we&amp;rsquo;ll just write down the result
$$
j_{\mathrm{ff}, \nu} = \frac{8}{3} \left ( \frac{2 \pi}{3} \right)^{1/2} g_{\mathrm{ff}, i} \frac{e^6}{m_e^2 c^3} \left ( \frac{m_e}{kT} \right)^{1/2} e^{- h \nu / k T} n_e Z_i^2 n_i
$$
$$
j_{\mathrm{ff}, \nu} = 5.444 \times 10^{-41} g_\mathrm{ff} T_4^{-1/2} e^{- h \nu / k T} Z_i^2 n_i n_e \;\mathrm{erg}\;\mathrm{cm}^3\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}\;\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\;\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}
$$
here \(n_i\) represents the ions, and \(n_e\) represents the electrons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\(g_{\mathrm{ff},i}(\nu, T)\) is the &lt;strong>Gaunt factor for free-free transitions&lt;/strong>. When doing classical physics, Gaunt factor = 1. It&amp;rsquo;s different from 1 when we need to treat quantum mechanical effects. Even then, the correction factor is only 1 order of magnitude different from 1, across a wide range of frequencies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we assume that \(g_{\mathrm{ff},i}(\nu, T)\) is constant (w \(\nu\)), then the emissivity is flat (independent) with frequency at low frequencies.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can calculate the power radiated per volume as
$$
\Lambda_\mathrm{ff} = 4 \pi \int_0^\infty j_{\mathrm{ff},\nu} d \nu
$$
and we get that
$$
\Lambda_\mathrm{ff} \propto n_i n_e \sqrt{T}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See Draine 10.2 and 10.3 for how to properly calculate and average over the Gaunt factor for various regimes.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="free-free-absorption">Free-free absorption&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If we have a thermal distribution, then Kirchoff&amp;rsquo;s law must be satisfied
$$
B_\nu = \frac{j_\nu}{\kappa_\nu}
$$
where \(B_\nu\) is the Planck function. Kirchoff&amp;rsquo;s law is a neat trick, because we can go calculate the attenuation coefficient \(\kappa_\nu\) from the emissivity \(j_\nu\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\kappa_{\mathrm{ff},\nu} = \frac{4}{3} \left ( \frac{2 \pi}{3} \right)^{1/2} \frac{e^6}{m_e{3/2} (k T)^{1/2} h c \nu^3} \left [ 1 - e^{- h \nu / k T} \right] Z_i^2 n_i n_e g_\mathrm{ff}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>from the frequency dependence, we see that free-free absorption becomes strong at low (radio) frequencies.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="emission-measure">Emission Measure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Calculate the intensity \(I_\nu\) from free-free emission from an ionized region
$$
I_\nu(s) = I_\nu(0) e^{-\tau_\nu} + \int_0^s d s^\prime j_{\mathrm{ff},\nu} e^{-[\tau_\nu(s) - \tau_nu(s^\prime)]}
$$
$$
I_\nu(s) = I_\nu(0) e^{-\tau_\nu} + \int_0^{\tau_\nu} d \tau^\prime \left [ \frac{j_{\mathrm{ff}, \nu}}{\kappa_{\mathrm{ff}, \nu}} \right] e^{-(\tau - \tau^\prime)}
$$
If the region has a uniform temperature, then the integral becomes
$$
I_\nu = I_\nu(0) e^{-\tau_\nu} + \left [ \frac{j_{\mathrm{ff}, \nu}}{\kappa_{\mathrm{ff}, \nu}} \right]&lt;em>T (1 - e^{-\tau&lt;/em>\nu})
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now let&amp;rsquo;s define something called the &lt;em>emission measure&lt;/em>
$$
EM = \int n_e n_p ds = \left [ \frac{n_e n_p}{\kappa_{\mathrm{ff},\nu}} \right ]&lt;em>T \tau&lt;/em>\nu.
$$
Since most clouds are net neutral, we can write
$$
EM \approx \int n_e^2 ds.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can rewrite the RTE,
$$
I_\nu = I_\nu(0) e^{-\tau_\nu} + \frac{(1 - e^{-\tau_\nu})}{\tau_\nu} \left [ \frac{j_{\mathrm{ff},\nu}}{n_e n_p} \right ]&lt;em>T EM
$$
when we are very optically thin (\(\tau \ll 1 \)), we have
$$
\frac{(1 - e^{-\tau&lt;/em>\nu})}{\tau_\nu} \approx 1.
$$
We can plug back in for the Brehmsstralung emissivity and obtain the result that intensity &lt;em>increases linearly with EM&lt;/em>. See Draine Ch 10.5 for prefactors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For low frequencies \(\nu \leq 1 \) GHz, self-absorption can become important in dense H II regions. Generally negligible in other ISM settings.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="free-bound-transitions-recombination-continuum">Free-bound transitions: Recombination continuum&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Electron captured by an ion, making the transition from a &amp;ldquo;free&amp;rdquo; state to a &amp;ldquo;bound&amp;rdquo; state, and emitting a photon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How might we calculate the emissivity \(j_{\mathrm{fb},\nu}\) for this interaction, assuming LTE (i.e., thermal plasma)?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s think about the tools that we need: \(\kappa_\nu\), \(B_\nu\), \(\sigma\), \(n_b\)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s one way to go about it. In our second lecture on collisional processes, we used the impact approximation to approximately calculate the cross section for photoionization, \(\sigma_b\). We assumed there was an electron with some kinetic energy, it engaged in some momentum transfer with the atom, and this extra change in momentum unbound it&amp;rsquo;s own electron, ionizing the atom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, we know that we can use our result from the radiative process lecture for net absorption
$$
\kappa_\nu = n_l \sigma_{l \rightarrow u}(\nu) - n_u \sigma_{u \rightarrow l}(\nu)
$$
to write
$$
\kappa_\nu = n_l \sigma_b(\nu) \left [ 1 - e^{-h \nu/k T_\mathrm{exc}} \right].
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Next, let&amp;rsquo;s reuse Kirchoff&amp;rsquo;s law to relate
$$
j_{\mathrm{fb}, \nu} = \kappa_{\mathrm{bf}, \nu} B_\nu(T)
$$
and, since we are in LTE, \(T_\mathrm{exc} = T\), so
$$
j_{\mathrm{fb}, \nu} = n_b \sigma_b(\nu) \left [ 1 - e^{-h \nu/k T} \right ] B_\nu(T)
$$
where \(n_b\) is the number density of atoms in bound state b, if in LTE with electron density \(n_e\), and ion density \(n_i\). For example, \(n_b\) could be the number of hydrogen atoms with principle quantum number \(n=3\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, we would like to rewrite \(n_b\) in terms of the overall number densities of electrons and ions and the temperature of the plasma, because in a moment we&amp;rsquo;re going to want to consider multiple different bound states. To do this, we need to refer back to the statistical mechanics lecture and the &lt;em>law of mass action&lt;/em>. One result from that lecture was the ability to take the reaction for photoionization
$$
H(n) + e^- \leftrightarrow H^+ + 2e^-
$$
and write down the relative number densities, obtaining&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\left [ \frac{n(H(n))}{n(H^+) n_e} \right]_\mathrm{LTE} = \left [ \frac{h^3}{(2 \pi k T)^{3/2}} \right] \left [ \frac{m_H}{m_p m_e} \right]^{3/2} \frac{g[H(n)]}{g(e^-) g(H^+)} e^{-I_n/kT}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>where&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
I_n = \frac{I_H}{n^2}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>is the energy required to ionize \(H(n)\). Finally, putting it all together, we have&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
j_{\mathrm{fb},\nu} = \frac{g_b}{2 g_i} \frac{h^4 \nu^3}{(2 \pi m_e k T)^{3/2} c^2} e^{(I_b - h \nu)/k T} \sigma_b(\nu) n_e n_i
$$
where \(g_b\) is the degeneracy of the bound state, \(g_i\) is the degeneracy of the ion, and \(I_b\) is the energy required to ionize from bound state.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, what did we do? We started with a photoionization cross section, related that to an absorption coefficient, used Kirchoff&amp;rsquo;s law and LTE assumptions to relate &lt;em>that&lt;/em> to an emissivity, and then rewrote the number densities of the bound state \(n_b\) in terms of more-easily calculable quantities, \(n_e\) and \(n_i\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some take aways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Generally, the free-bound emissivity is proportional to
$$
j_{\mathrm{fb},\nu} \propto n_e n_i.
$$&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Each bound state contributes its own bit of recombination continuum starting at \(h \nu = I_b\), which is the minimum energy photon that can be emitted when an electron transitions from free to bound state b&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The recombination continuum tapers off at higher frequncies by the factor \(e^{(I_b - h \nu)/k T} \)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Now let&amp;rsquo;s examine this emission spectrum for a hydrogen plasma&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Three-body collisional processes can populate hydrogen atoms with very high quantum states \(n \gtrsim 100\), which are also called &lt;strong>Rydberg&lt;/strong> states. These high states can also undergo spontaneous decay to lower levels, such as the

&lt;p>So far we&amp;rsquo;ve talked about the&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>intrinsic line profile, whose width comes about from quantum mechanical uncertainty, and takes on a Lorentzian form&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gaussian line profile, which comes about from thermal motions&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In truth, we have a convolution of these two profiles, called a Voigt profile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\phi_\nu^\mathrm{Voigt} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi}}\frac{1}{\nu_{ul}}\frac{c}{b}H(a,u)
$$
where \(H(a,u)\) is a dimensionless function describing the shape of the Voigt profile. It was first tabulated by Frode Hjerting in 1938, and is why we call this combined thing the Voigt-Hjerting function. You can use a special functions library to calculate this profile exactly; for our purposes, we are mainly concerned with observing the astrophysical behaviors that manifest from the fact that this profile has &lt;em>both&lt;/em> a Gaussian core and Lorentzian wings. You can think of the \(a\) parameter (what R&amp;amp;P term the ratio of intrinsic broadening to thermal broadening) as a tuning between its &amp;ldquo;Gaussian-ness&amp;rdquo; (low \(a\)) and its &amp;ldquo;Lorentzian-ness&amp;rdquo; (high \(a\)).&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="building-absorption-lines">Building absorption lines&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that we have a known background source illuminating some neutral hydrogen cloud with known&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>number density \(n_l\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>temperature&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Einstein coefficients for the transition&lt;/li>
&lt;li>assume the cloud is cold enough so that we can ignore spontaneous emission &lt;em>and&lt;/em> \(j_\nu \approx 0 \)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>\(\phi_\nu\) is constant everywhere&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>What does the absorption line look like?&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is just another way of asking what is the emergent \(I_\nu\), where in this case we are additionally interested in the \(\nu\) dependence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So let&amp;rsquo;s write down the RTE and get cracking.
$$
I_\nu(\tau_\nu) = I_\nu(0)e^{-\tau_\nu} + \int_0^{\tau_\nu} e^{-(\tau_\nu - \tau^\prime)}S_\nu d \tau^\prime
$$
Since
$$
S_\nu = \frac{j_\nu}{\kappa_\nu} \approx 0
$$
we have
$$
I_\nu(\tau_\nu) = I_\nu(0)e^{-\tau_\nu}
$$
For this problem, we basically have some initial (known) intensity that is attenuated by the intervening absorbers. The thing we want to calculate is the optical depth \(\tau_\nu\), which we do by
$$
\tau_\nu = \int \kappa_\nu d s = \int n_l \sigma_{lu}(\nu) ds
$$
$$
\tau_\nu = \frac{g_u}{g_l}\frac{c^2}{8 \pi \nu^2_{ul}}A_{ul} \int n_l \phi_\nu ds
$$
and from our assumptions we have \(\phi_\nu\) constant along line of sight so we can take
$$
\int n_l ds = N_l
$$
to a column density, and result in
$$
\tau_\nu = \frac{g_u}{g_l}\frac{c^2}{8 \pi \nu^2_{ul}}A_{ul} N_l \phi_\nu.
$$
Remember that \(\phi_\nu\) is our Voigt profile.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can plug this back in and solve for the emergent intensity we were after
$$
I_\nu(\tau_\nu) = I_\nu(0)e^{-\tau_\nu}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>When \(\tau_\nu &amp;lt; 1\), we can use the small exponent approximation to show that
$$
\frac{I_\nu(0) - I_\nu(\tau_\nu)}{I_\nu(0)} \approx \tau_\nu
$$
meaning that the absorption line profile \(I_\nu\) follows the optical depth \(\tau_\nu\) as a function of frequency.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>When \(\tau_\nu \gg 1\), though, we get \(I_\nu(0)e^{-\tau_\nu} \approx 0\). Cold, dense, optically thick things (that are not emitting themselves) &lt;em>block light&lt;/em>!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="fig_2_6.jpg"

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s the relationship between \(I_\nu\) and \(F_\nu\) here? We&amp;rsquo;re just considering a single small patch with differential solid angle \(\Delta \Omega\), assuming that the properties of the source are uniform over that area, so then the integral is over a constant area and we have
$$
I_\nu \propto F_\nu.
$$
So in this discussion about absorption lines and curve and growth, you may see \(F_\nu\) and \(I_\nu\) used interchangeably.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="equivalent-width">Equivalent width&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Equivalent width is a convenient and quick &lt;em>but imperfect&lt;/em> way to boil down a rich measurement of \(I_\nu\) into a single number for tabulation.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="equivalent_width.jpg"

&lt;p>The equivalent width corresponding to the absorption line. Credit: Wikipedia/Szdori&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>How to calculate equivalent width?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Take high resolution spectrum of a source&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Estimate the baseline &amp;ldquo;continuum&amp;rdquo; level from spectral regions that do not show absorption lines. Call this \(F_\nu(0)\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Integrate over (sum up) the absorption line region \(F_\nu\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Compare how much of the continuum region you&amp;rsquo;d need (absorbed at 100%) to match the integrated absorption in the actual line&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The equivalent width is \(W\), and, confusingly, there are many different definitions out there in the wild.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re working at optical wavelengths, I always found the &amp;ldquo;wavelength equivalent width&amp;rdquo; to be the easiest to comprehend, which is calculated using \(F_\lambda\) common to optical spectra
$$
W_\lambda = \int \frac{\mathrm{continuum} - \mathrm{line}(\lambda)}{\mathrm{continuum}} d \lambda
$$
and has units of wavelength. Phrased with mathematical symbols
$$
W_\lambda = \int \frac{F_\lambda(0) - F_\lambda }{F_\lambda(0)} d \lambda.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>There are other definitions&lt;/em>! For example, R&amp;amp;P and Draine prefer a dimensionless equivalent width
$$
W = \int \frac{d \nu}{\nu_0} \left [ 1 - \frac{F_\nu}{F_\nu(0)} \right] = \int \frac{d \nu}{\nu_0} ( 1 - e^{-\tau_\nu}).
$$
We&amp;rsquo;ll use the dimensionless equivalent width for any problem sets and tests (it has no units). They are related via
$$
W_\lambda \approx \lambda_0 W.
$$
The problem with the wavelength width is that if you measure \(W_\lambda = 1\)Å, it corresponds to a very different set of physical conditions if you&amp;rsquo;re looking at a line with line center \(\lambda = 4000\)Å vs \(\lambda = 8000\)Å. This is because we would expect
$$
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda}
$$
to be approximately constant across the spectrum, and this is captured by the dimensionless equivalent width. There is also a velocity-equivalent width (\(W_v = c W\)). So, if you&amp;rsquo;re going to compare equivalent widths, make sure you &lt;em>understand the definition that is being used&lt;/em>. Some authors define \(W &amp;gt; 0\) for emission lines, others for absorption lines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Much of the historical literature focuses on equivalent width measurements, and comparing these.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>My recommendation&lt;/strong>: If you are lucky to have a high resolution spectrum of an object, realize that &lt;em>you have a lot of information&lt;/em> in how \(F_\nu\) varies with \(\nu\). Why go destroy some of it just to represent it as a single number? If you have a detailed physical model, you can fit \(F_\nu\) directly. Don&amp;rsquo;t bother thinking too hard about equivalent widths.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, lets look at some real absorption lines and see why we&amp;rsquo;d actually want to take a look at the spectra themselves rather than just reporting a single number, \(W\).
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="fig_2_2.jpg"
alt="UV interstellar absorption lines. Figure 2.2 Ryden and Pogge"/>&lt;figcaption>
&lt;p>UV interstellar absorption lines. Figure 2.2 Ryden and Pogge&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That said, it&amp;rsquo;s worthwhile thinking about how a line saturates with increasing optical depth, and the measure of equivalent width is useful for this exercise. Our goal is to&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Measure some line profile&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Make some assessment of the optical depth&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use the line depth/shape and our understanding of radiative transfer to arrive at some conclusion about the column density of absorbers \(N_l\).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="curve-of-growth">Curve of growth&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s examine how the line profile changes with increasing optical depth at line center, \(\tau_0\). &lt;em>Note&lt;/em>: optical depth is not the same for all \(\lambda\), i.e., we have \(\tau_\lambda\) or \(\tau_\nu\)! That&amp;rsquo;s the point of the whole upcoming discussion!&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The &lt;strong>curve of growth&lt;/strong> is a relationship between the observed equivalent width \(W\) and the optical depth at line center \(\tau_0\).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Curve of growth for the same Lyman \(\alpha\) line. Figure 2.7 from Ryden and Pogge.&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Note that the curve of growth is a &lt;em>log-log&lt;/em> plot! It is divided up into three regimes&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="linear">Linear&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>optically thin&lt;/li>
&lt;li>only the Gaussian core of a line contributes significant EW&lt;/li>
&lt;li>\(W\) is linear with \(\tau_0\) (and thus also with \(N_l\))&lt;/li>
&lt;li>\(N_l\) can be directly calculated from a measurement of \(W\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>thermal broadening of the line cancels out in determination of \(N_l\) (good, we don&amp;rsquo;t need to know temperature!)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="damping-optical-depth">Damping Optical Depth&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There is a transition whether the Lorentzian wings provide much contribution to the equivalent width calculation. This is called the damping optical depth \(\tau_\mathrm{damp}\), and depends on temperature as well as the properties of the absorber.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For \(1 \leq \tau_0 \leq \tau_\mathrm{damp} \), this is the flat portion.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For \(\tau_0 \geq \tau_\mathrm{damp}\), this is the &amp;ldquo;square-root&amp;rdquo; or damped portion&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For the line in this plot, \(\tau_\mathrm{damp} \approx 10^{3.5}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="flat">Flat&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>optically thick but not so much that the Lorentzian wings provide much contribution to equivalent width calculation (they remain shallow): \(0 \leq \tau_0 \leq \tau_\mathrm{damp}\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>optical depth &lt;em>does depend&lt;/em> on the thermal broadening parameter of the line, therefore we need to know temperature&lt;/li>
&lt;li>\(W\) grows grows excruciatingly slowly with optical depth, therefore trying to turn \(W\) into a measurement on \(N_l\) is very risky, since your error in \(W\) will &lt;em>propagate exponentially&lt;/em> into an error on \(N_l\).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="square-root-or-damped-portion">Square-root or &amp;ldquo;damped&amp;rdquo; portion&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;em>so&lt;/em> optically thick that even the Lorentzian wings &amp;ldquo;damping wings&amp;rdquo; are getting deep and contributing significantly to the equivalent width calculation \(\tau_0 \geq \tau_\mathrm{damp}\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>after we&amp;rsquo;ve exceeded the damping optical depth column density \(N_l\) is again independent of thermal broadening parameter&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For reference, you can walk through R&amp;amp;P Ch 2.4 or Draine Chs. 9.2, 9.3, and 9.4 for the calculations and approximations underlying these behaviors of the curve of growth.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="doublet-ratios">Doublet ratios&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If an absorbing level can transition to two different excited states \(u_1\) or \(u_2\), we can calculate the relative equivalent widths of those two transitions. This gives us confidence in assessing whether the transition is actually in the optically thin limit, and we can derive a more accurate result. E.g., you may see this for the Ca II K and Ca II H doublet transitions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lyman-alpha">Lyman \(\alpha\)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the ISM, atomic (neutral) hydrogen is almost always found in the ground state, and therefore the Lyman transitions are the most important. A &lt;strong>resonance line&lt;/strong> is one that has permitted absorption out of the electronic ground state.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Lyman \(\alpha\) transition \(1s \rightarrow 2p\) is very important because it allows us to directly measure the column density of atomic hydrogen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Deuterium has a slightly frequency shifted Lyman series, which, in some cases, allows us to measure absorption lines for both hydrogen and deuterium, and therefore determine a D\H ratio for the interstellar/galactic gas.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lyman-limit">Lyman limit&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Happens as \(n \rightarrow \infty\) and the wavelength differences between adjacent transitions from ground state smush together. You get a bit of a &amp;ldquo;continuum&amp;rdquo; opacity that has a cross-section that is very similar to that of the photoionization we covered in previous lectures. This is because a transition from ground state to very high \(n\) is very similar to that of an ionization cross section.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="metal-lines">Metal lines&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many resonance lines for metals are in the ultraviolet, so you can only observe them from space, or using optical means for highly redshifted systems. Notable exceptions are Na I doublet, the K I doublet, and the Ca II doublet.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="gas-phase-abundances">Gas phase abundances&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Observed abundances vary from sightline to sightline, which is presumably evidence that elements end up trapped in dust grains. This removal of various elements is called &lt;em>interstellar depletion&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Warm neutral medium: has high abundances&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cold neutral medium: has lower abundances&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Warm ionized medium: very high abundances&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Diffuse molecular clouds: very low abundances&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Ryden and Pogge Ch. 3.3: Exciting Hyperfine Energy Levels&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This is the first lecture where we&amp;rsquo;re moving a bit from the core processes and moving back towards a discussion of the many &amp;ldquo;phases&amp;rdquo; of the ISM.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just as a review, we had (according to Draine):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Coronal gas, &amp;ldquo;hot ionized medium&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;HIM&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>H II gas, dense H II regions, diffuse H II regions, &amp;ldquo;warm ionized medium&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;WIM&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Warm H I, &amp;ldquo;warm neutral medium&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;WNM&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool H I, &amp;ldquo;cold neutral medium&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;CNM&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Diffuse molecular gas&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dense molecular gas&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stellar outflows&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So, in talking about H I emission and absorption, we&amp;rsquo;re primarily talking about the warm neutral medium (R&amp;amp;P Ch 3) and the cold neutral medium (R&amp;amp;P Ch 2). We&amp;rsquo;re following Draine in a linear manner; these concepts are swapped slightly in R&amp;amp;P.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>ISM phases are ionization state, density, and temperature.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cold neutral medium&lt;/strong>: absorption lines (from previous lectures, will also be covered in Friday&amp;rsquo;s lecture). T approx 100 K, \(n_H = 30 \;\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\) and neutral. Volume fraction of 1%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Warm Neutral Medium&lt;/strong>: T approx 5000 K, \(n_H = 0.6\;\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\) and neutral. Volume fraction of 40%.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Taken together, cold neutral medium and warm neutral medium contain over half of the mass of the Milky Way Galaxy&amp;rsquo;s ISM. Observationally, we can study this neutral atomic hydrogen directly via the hyperfine transition.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Magnetic moment of electron coupled to magnetic moment of proton creates a &amp;ldquo;hyperfine&amp;rdquo; split between the parallel and antiparallel spin states.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="anti-parallel-state">Anti-parallel state&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>has lower energy \(E_l = 0\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>degeneracy \(g_l = 1\)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="parallel-state">Parallel state&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>total spin \(S = 1\), degeneracy \( g_u = 2 S + 1 = 3\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>\(E_u - E_l = 5.87\times10^{-6}\) eV&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When the electron drops from parallel to anti-parallel states, the photon emitted has wavelength
$$
\lambda = \frac{h c}{E_u - E_l} = 21.11\,\mathrm{cm}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s think a little bit about how this transition gets populated. Using the same concept of excitation temperature, but here we&amp;rsquo;re going to call it &lt;em>spin temperature&lt;/em>
$$
\frac{n_u}{n_l} = \frac{g_u}{g_l}e^{(E_l - E_u)/kT_\mathrm{spin}}.
$$
We can plug in the values for the spin flip transition and simplify the equation and
$$
\frac{E_l - E_u}{k} = 0.0682\;\mathrm{K}.
$$
is the temperature corresponding to the energy of the spin flip transition. Then the relative population levels are
$$
\frac{n_u}{n_l} = 3 e^{-0.0682\;\mathrm{K}/T_\mathrm{spin}},
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How does \( e^{-0.0682\;\mathrm{K}/T_\mathrm{spin}}\) behave? Unless \(T_\mathrm{spin} \lesssim 0.0682\;\mathrm{K}\), the exponent is approximately zero, and \(e^0 = 1\). We can explore this relationship for a range of spin temperatures, and we see that \(n_u/n_l \approx 3\) for all but the &lt;em>very coldest&lt;/em> spin temperatures.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thinking about material out there in space, can someone tell me the coldest something is likely to be if it&amp;rsquo;s just sitting out there in interstellar space, even close to LTE? The CMB puts a pretty good lower bound on \(T\) so long as nothing funny is happening, since \(T_\mathrm{CMB} = 2.725\;\mathrm{K}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even the average CMB photon is much more energetic than this, \(T_\mathrm{CMB} = 2.725\;\mathrm{K}\), so these upper levels can be and are easily populated!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="emissivity">Emissivity&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>So we reach the interesting conclusion that the level populations of H I 21cm transitions are
$$
n_u \approx \frac{3}{4} n(\mathrm{H\;I})
$$
$$
n_l \approx \frac{1}{4} n(\mathrm{H\;I})
$$
&lt;em>independent&lt;/em> of any astrophysically practical spin temperatures. Because the upper level always contains approximatel 75% of the H I, this means that the H I 21cm emissivity is also &lt;em>independent&lt;/em> of the spin temperature, and we have
$$
j_\nu = n_u \frac{A_{ul}}{4 \pi} h \nu_{ul} \phi_\nu = \frac{3}{16\pi} A_{ul} h \nu_{ul} n(\mathrm{H\;I}) \phi_\nu.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="absorption-coefficient">Absorption coefficient&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Following similar manipulations we covered in Draine Chs. 6 and 7, we can write the absorption coefficient
$$
\kappa_\nu = n_l \sigma_{lu} - n_u |\sigma_{ul}|
$$
$$
\kappa_\nu = n_l \frac{g_u}{g_l} \frac{A_{ul}}{8 \pi} \lambda_{ul}^2 \phi_\nu \left [ 1 - \frac{n_u}{n_l} \frac{g_l}{g_u} \right]
$$
$$
\kappa_\nu = n_l \frac{g_u}{g_l} \frac{A_{ul}}{8 \pi} \lambda_{ul}^2 \phi_\nu \left [ 1 - e^{-h \nu_{ul} / k T_\mathrm{spin}} \right]
$$
as we just discussed, \( e^{-h \nu_{ul} / k T_\mathrm{spin}} \approx 1\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What does \(\kappa_\nu\) represent? It&amp;rsquo;s the &lt;em>net&lt;/em> absorption coefficient, meaning it&amp;rsquo;s the true (total) absorption minus the contribution from stimulated emission.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we have \( e^{-h \nu_{ul} / k T_\mathrm{spin}} \approx 1\), the upper state is going to fairly populated, so what does that say about stimulated emission? It means that it is significant and we need to include it in our calculations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using the small x approximation \(e^{-x} \approx 1 - x\) for \(x \ll 1\), we can finally simplify to
$$
\kappa_\nu \approx \frac{3}{32 \pi} A_{ul} \frac{h c \lambda_{ul}}{k T_\mathrm{spin}} n(\mathrm{H\;I}) \phi_\nu
$$
and we find that the absorption coefficient depends on spin temperature like
$$
\kappa_\nu \propto \frac{1}{T_\mathrm{spin}}
$$
i.e., it gets large when the spin temperature is low and the lower level is populated (subject to our assumption that \(h \nu_{ul} / k T_\mathrm{spin} \ll 1\) for the conditions of interest).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the spin temperature gets very high, we aren&amp;rsquo;t going to have much &lt;em>net&lt;/em> absorption (\(\kappa_\nu \approx 0 \)), because every truly absorbed photon will be balanced out by one contributed from stimulated emission.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="example-calculation">Example calculation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Assume a Gaussian internal velocity distribution for the H I cloud with dispersion \(\sigma_V\). Assume we are looking at a frequency \(\nu\), which corresponds to a Doppler shift of \(u\), where
$$
\nu = \nu_{ul}(1 - u/c)
$$
and yields a normalized line profile of
$$
\phi_\nu = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \frac{c}{\nu_{ul}} \frac{1}{\sigma_V}e^{-u^2/2 \sigma_V^2}
$$
The absorption coefficient is
$$
\kappa_\nu = 2.190\times10^{-19}\;\mathrm{cm}^2\;n(\mathrm{H\;I}) \frac{K}{T_\mathrm{spin}} \frac{\mathrm{km\;s}^{-1}}{\sigma_V} e^{-u^2/2 \sigma^2_V}.
$$
We can find optical depth
$$
d\tau = \kappa_\nu ds.
$$
Let&amp;rsquo;s assume the properties of the cloud (spin temp, velocity dispersion) are constant along the line of sight, and write down column density as
$$
N(\mathrm{H\;I}) = \int n(\mathrm{H\;I}) ds
$$
then we have,
$$
\tau_\nu = 2.190 \frac{N(\mathrm{H\;I})}{10^{21}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}} \frac{100\;\mathrm{K}}{T_\mathrm{spin}} \frac{\mathrm{km\;s}^{-1}}{\sigma_V} e^{-u^2/2 \sigma_V^2}.
$$
What column density do we need for the line of sight to be marginally optically thick (\( \tau_\nu \gtrsim 1\))?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many sightlines have \(N(\mathrm{H\;I}) \gtrsim 10^{21}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\), spin temperatures of \(T_\mathrm{spin} \approx 10^2\;\mathrm{K}\), and velocity dispersions of a few km/s, which means self-absorption of the 21-cm line can be important.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="optically-thin-cloud">Optically Thin Cloud&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Assume a cloud with
$$
N(\mathrm{H\;I}) \lesssim 10^{20}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\frac{T_\mathrm{spin}}{100\,\mathrm{K}} \frac{\sigma_V}{\mathrm{km\;s}^{-1}}
$$
such that \(\tau_\nu \lesssim 0.2\) even at line center (i.e., it&amp;rsquo;s optically thin).&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Assume that we can neglect absorption. How would we calculate the emergent intensity \(I_\nu\) from this cloud, using the equation of radiative transfer?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Using the path length formulation,
$$
I_\nu = I_\nu(0) + \int j_\nu ds.
$$
Let&amp;rsquo;s take our equation for \(j_\nu\) from before, assume constant properties along the ray, and use the idea that
$$
N(\mathrm{H\;I}) = \int n(\mathrm{H\;I}) ds
$$
we have
$$
I_\nu = I_\nu(0) + \frac{3}{16\pi}A_{ul} h \nu_{ul} \phi_\nu N(\mathrm{H\;I}).
$$
Assume we know \(I_\nu(0)\) from somewhere else. Rearrange and calculate the intensity contribution from the cloud, over all frequencies
$$
\int \left [ I_\nu - I_\nu(0) \right] d \nu = \frac{3}{16\pi}A_{ul} h \nu_{ul} N(\mathrm{H\;I})
$$
because we know \(\int \phi_\nu d\nu = 1\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s rewrite this using antenna temperature and relative velocity \(u\)
$$
\int \left [ T_A - T_A(0) \right] du = \int \frac{c^2}{2 k \nu^2} \left [I_\nu - I_\nu(0) \right] \frac{c}{\nu} d\nu
$$
$$
\int \left [ T_A - T_A(0) \right] du = 54.89\;\mathrm{K\;km\;s}^{-1} \frac{N(\mathrm{H\;I})}{10^{20}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}}
$$
This relationship allows us to&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>make an integrated line intensity measurement of 21-cm emission&lt;/li>
&lt;li>calculate the total H I column density \(N(\mathrm{H\;I})\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>without needing to know \(T_\mathrm{spin}\)! (as long as self-absorption not important)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If we can assume optically thin emission, we can even estimate the total H I mass in another galaxy.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Assumptions&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>we have a bright background radio source with a &amp;ldquo;known&amp;rdquo; continuum spectrum \(T_\mathrm{RS}\), or at least known that it should be intrinsically flat within some frequency range&lt;/li>
&lt;li>cloud (ISM) properties are uniform across the two sightlines: \(N(\mathrm{H\;I})\) and \(T_\mathrm{spin}\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>nothing behind the &amp;ldquo;off&amp;rdquo; sightline, just blank sky whose antenna temperature \(T_\mathrm{sky}\) we can measure/approximate from nearby measurements in space and frequency.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Using the fact that specific intensity and antenna temperature have a linear relationship, take the RTE in integral form and write down the relationships between all of the temperatures in the Figure, assuming a radial velocity \(v\).
$$
T_A^\mathrm{off}(v) = T_\mathrm{sky}e^{-\tau_\nu} + T_\mathrm{spin}(1 - e^{-\tau_\nu})
$$
and
$$
T_A^\mathrm{on}(v) = T_\mathrm{RS} e^{-\tau_\nu} + T_\mathrm{spin}(1 - e^{-\tau_\nu}).
$$
Then, solve for \(\tau_\nu\) and \(T_\mathrm{spin}\)
$$
\tau(v) = \ln \left [ \frac{T_\mathrm{RS} - T_\mathrm{sky}}{T_A^\mathrm{on}(v) - T_A^\mathrm{off}} \right]
$$
and
$$
T_\mathrm{spin} = \frac{T_A^\mathrm{off}(v) T_\mathrm{RS} - T_A^\mathrm{on}(v) T_\mathrm{sky}}{(T_\mathrm{RS} - T_\mathrm{sky}) - [T_A^\mathrm{on}(v) - T_A^\mathrm{off}(v)]}.
$$
When absorption is strong,&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>\(T_\mathrm{RS} - T_\mathrm{sky}\) is measurably larger than \(T_A^\mathrm{on}(v) - T_A^\mathrm{off}\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>can calculate \(\tau_\nu\) and \(T_\mathrm{spin}\)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If absorption is weak,&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>can&amp;rsquo;t tell the difference between \(T_\mathrm{RS} - T_\mathrm{sky}\) vs. \(T_A^\mathrm{on}(v) - T_A^\mathrm{off}\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>upper limit on \(\tau (v)\) and lower limit on \(T_\mathrm{spin}(v)\).&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Radiative transfer describes the propagation of radiation through absorbing and emitting media.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Wednesday&amp;rsquo;s lecture, we introduced specific intensity \(I_\nu\) and photon occupation number \(n_\gamma(\nu)\).&lt;/p>

$$

$$
I_\nu = B_\nu(T) = \frac{2 h\nu^3}{\exp(h \nu / kT) - 1}

&lt;li>Brightness temperature \(T_B(\nu)\) (units K) is a way to characterize a &lt;em>specific intensity&lt;/em> (or surface brightness). Given some specific intensity \(I_\nu\), it is defined as the temperature such that a blackbody at that temperature has that specific intensity, i.e.,
$$
T_B(\nu) = \frac{h \nu / k}{\ln[1 + 2 h \nu^3/c^2 I_\nu]}
$$&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>On it&amp;rsquo;s own, quoting a brightness temperature &lt;em>says nothing about whether the astrophysical source is in LTE&lt;/em>. In fact, brightness temperature is commonly used to describe sources that are far from LTE or isotropic (masers, GRBs, etc.) You could alternatively describe the specific intensity (or surface brightness) in units of Jy/ster, for example, since that is what the Planck function provides (given some temperature).&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Antenna temperature \(T_A\) (units K) is just like brightness temperature, only we make the assumption that we&amp;rsquo;re in the Rayleigh-Jeans limit of \(k T_A \gg h \nu\) or \(n_\gamma \gg 1\) so we have
$$
T_A(\nu) = \frac{c^2}{2 k \nu^2} I_\nu
$$&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Again, an antenna temperature says &lt;em>nothing about whether the astrophysical source is in LTE&lt;/em>, it is a convenient way to describe a specific intensity or surface brightness. If you&amp;rsquo;re going to use temperature as a shorthand for specific intensity (without needing to appeal to LTE temperature), antenna temperature is a good one to use because it is &lt;em>linear&lt;/em> in intensity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>BUT&lt;/strong>, if a source &lt;em>is&lt;/em> in LTE with temperature \(T\), then we will have \(T_B = T\), and if we&amp;rsquo;re observing at radio wavelengths, \(T_A \approx T\) as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Remember from last lecture we said that &lt;em>in LTE&lt;/em> we could calculate the relative level populations between two states using the Boltzmann distribution
$$
\frac{n_u}{n_l} = \frac{g_u}{g_l}e^{(E_l - E_u)/kT}
$$
&lt;em>Given some relative population&lt;/em> of two levels, we can define a quantity called excitation temperature
$$
\frac{n_u}{n_l} = \frac{g_u}{g_l}e^{(E_l - E_u)/kT_\mathrm{exc}}.
$$
So an excitation temperature (in K) is a way to communicate the relative population of two levels. In LTE, \(T_\mathrm{exc} = T\).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Equation of radiative transfer. Consider a ray or beam of radiation. Neglect scattering.
$$
d I_\nu = - I_\nu \kappa_\nu ds + j_\nu ds
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The first term is the net change in \(I_\nu\) due to absorption and stimulated emission.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The second term is the change in \(I_\nu\) due to spontaneous emission by the material in the path of the beam&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="emission-and-absorption-coefficients">Emission and absorption coefficients&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>\(\kappa_\nu\) is attenuation coefficient, and has dimensions of [1/cm]. Usually positive, except for masers/lasers, where it&amp;rsquo;s negative. Rybicki and Lightman call this \(\alpha_\nu\).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>\(j_\nu\) is emissivity, with units power per unit volume per frequency per unit solid angle&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For something with energy levels (and randomly oriented in space)
$$
j_\nu = \frac{1}{4 \pi} n_u A_{ul} h \nu \phi_\nu
$$
where \(\phi_\nu\) is the normalized line profile from the previous lecture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Attenuation coefficient is proportional to the &lt;em>net absorption&lt;/em>, which is true absorption minus stimulated emission
$$
\kappa_\nu = n_l \sigma_{l \rightarrow u}(\nu) - n_u \sigma_{u \rightarrow l}(\nu)
$$
$$
\kappa_\nu = n_l \sigma_{l \rightarrow u}(\nu) \left [ 1 - \frac{n_u/n_l}{g_u/g_l} \right]
$$
$$
\kappa_\nu = n_l \sigma_{l \rightarrow u}(\nu) \left [ 1 - e^{-h \nu/k T_\mathrm{exc}} \right]
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="integrating-the-radiative-transfer-equation">Integrating the Radiative Transfer Equation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can do this as a function of pathlength, \(s\). E.g., carry out this numerically using an ODE solver.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, given the way absorption and emission works, it&amp;rsquo;s often very helpful to do a change of variables to an optical depth, \(\tau\). The differential optical depth is defined as
$$
d \tau_\nu = \kappa_\nu ds
$$
this definition assumes radiation propagates in the direction of increasing \(\tau\), and the radiative transfer equation becomes
$$
d I_\nu = - I_\nu d \tau_\nu + S_\nu d \tau_\nu
$$
where the source function is
$$
S_\nu = \frac{j_\nu}{\kappa_\nu}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Remember, no scattering included&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Again, you can solve radiative transfer problems using this ODE as is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can also get another useful form by using integrating factors to formally integrate the equation&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
e^{\tau_\nu} (d I_\nu + I_\nu d \tau_\nu) = e^{\tau_\nu} S_\nu d \tau_\nu
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
d(e^{\tau_\nu} I_\nu) = e^{\tau_\nu} S_\nu d \tau_\nu
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Choose some boundary condition \(\tau_\nu = 0\) with initial value \(I_\nu(0)\)
$$
e^{\tau}I_\nu - I_\nu(0) = \int_0^{\tau_\nu} e^{\tau^\prime} S_\nu d \tau^\prime
$$
multiply through by \(e^{-\tau_\nu}\) and we have the &lt;strong>equation of radiative transfer in integral form&lt;/strong>
$$
I_\nu(\tau_\nu) = I_\nu(0)e^{-\tau_\nu} + \int_0^{\tau_\nu} e^{-(\tau_\nu - \tau^\prime)}S_\nu d \tau^\prime
$$
\(S_\nu\) can be a function of position.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interpretation: the intensity at some optical depth \(\tau_\nu\) is&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the initial intensity \(I_\nu(0)\) attenuated by a factor \(e^{-\tau}\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>plus the integral over the emission \(S_\nu d \tau^\prime\) attenuated by the factor \(e^{-(\tau_\nu - \tau^\prime)}\) due to the effective emission from the point of emission.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When scattering is present, \(S_\nu\) contains a contribution from \(I_\nu\), so you cannot specify \(S_\nu\) a priori. Iterative schemes may be needed to solve to convergence (see modern RT packages).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="uniform-medium">Uniform medium&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Slab of uniform medium, energy levels populated according to a single excitation temperature \(T_\mathrm{exc}\), and the system is in LTE, so
$$
I_\nu = B_\nu(T_\mathrm{exc}) = S_\nu.
$$
If the system is in LTE, why must \(S_\nu = B_\nu\)? Otherwise the presence of the material would alter the radiation, and the system would not be in thermal equilibrium (but, by definition, it already is).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then the RTE becomes
$$
0 = d I_\nu = - B_\nu d \tau_\nu + S_\nu d \tau_\nu
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In LTE, \(j_\nu\) and \(\kappa_\nu\) only depend on the local properties of the matter. Then we can solve
$$
I_\nu = I_\nu(0) e^{-\tau_\nu} + B_\nu(T_\mathrm{exc})(1 - e^{-\tau_\nu})
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Think about what happens as we grow \(\tau_\nu\).&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>at \(\tau_\nu \approx 0\), we retain \(I_\nu(0)\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>at \(\tau \gg 1\), we obtain \(S_\nu = B_\nu\)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>You can also reverse the coordinates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about which pathlengths in this image (from the camera to the ground) are &amp;ldquo;optically thick&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;optically thin.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="optical_depth.png"/>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s scattering by water droplets here, so it&amp;rsquo;s not a perfect analogy. But the idea about optical depth is still relevant.&lt;/p>

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>the excitation temperature goes negative(!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>we have a population inversion&lt;/li>
&lt;li>stimulated emission is stronger than absorption&lt;/li>
&lt;li>radiation is amplified as it propagates&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Masing happens for microwave transitions of H I, OH, H2O, and SiO.
Some masers have brightness/antenna temperatures of \(T_A &amp;gt; 10^{11}\)K.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This means they would have a HUGE flux &lt;em>if&lt;/em> they were as spatially extended as other astronomical sources.

&lt;p>General rules for absorption and emission of radiation by absorbers with &lt;em>quantized&lt;/em> energy levels. Can be atoms, ions, molecules, dust grains, or anything that has (quantized) energy levels.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="absorption-of-photons">Absorption of photons&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Some absorber is in a lower level, there is radiation present that has
$$
h \nu = E_u - E_l
$$
the absorber can absorb a photon and undergo an upward transition
$$
X_l + h \nu \rightarrow X_u.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="rate-of-this-reaction">Rate of this reaction&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There is some \(n(X_l)\). The rate per volume at which absorbers absorb photons (\(l \rightarrow u\)) is proportional to the density of photons of the appropriate energy and the number density of absorbers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\underset{\mathrm{populate\;level}\;u}{\left ( \frac{\mathrm{d}n_u}{\mathrm{d}t} \right )_{l \rightarrow u}} = \underset{\mathrm{depopulate\;level}\;l}{- \left ( \frac{\mathrm{d}n_l}{\mathrm{d}t} \right)}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
= n_l B_{lu} u_\nu
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\(u_\nu\) is the radiation energy density per unit frequency.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\(B_{lu}\) is a proportionality constant called the Einstein B coefficient for the transition \(l \rightarrow u\).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="emission-of-photons">Emission of photons&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="spontaneous-emission">Spontaneous emission&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>$$
X_u \rightarrow X_l + h \nu
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Random process (independent of radiation field), and occurs with a probability per unit time \(A_{ul}\) called the Einstein A coefficient.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="stimulated-emission">Stimulated emission&lt;/h3>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="rate-of-emission">Rate of emission&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>From state \(u \rightarrow l\)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\left ( \frac{\mathrm{d}n_l}{\mathrm{d}t} \right) = - \left ( \frac{\mathrm{d}n_u}{\mathrm{d}t}\right) = n_u (A_{ul} + B_{ul} u_\nu)
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\(B_{ul}\) is the Einstein B coefficient for the downward transition.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="einstein-coefficients-are-not-independent">Einstein coefficients are not independent&lt;/h2>

B_{lu} = \frac{g_u}{g_l} B_{ul} = \frac{g_u}{g_l} \frac{c^3}{8 \pi h \nu^3} A_{ul}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Strength of stimulated emission (\(B_{ul}\)) and absorption (\(B_{lu}\)) are both determined by \(A_{ul}\) (spontaneous emission) and the ratio of the degeneracies \(\frac{g_u}{g_l}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="radiation-fields">Radiation fields&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>(Review from Rybicki and Lightman, Ch 1)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\(I_\nu \) is the &lt;em>specific intensity&lt;/em> of radiation, you can think of it as the energy carried along by an infinitesimal &amp;ldquo;bundle&amp;rdquo; of rays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has dimensions
$$
\mathrm{ergs}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\;\mathrm{ster}^{-1}\;\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}
$$
I like calling \(I_\nu\) the &amp;ldquo;specific intensity,&amp;rdquo; and that seems to be common usage in astronomy. In non-astronomy settings, this is called &amp;ldquo;spectral intensity.&amp;rdquo; If it is integrated over all frequency, it&amp;rsquo;s sometimes called the radiant intensity \(I\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\(I_\nu \) can be a little mind-bending to think about&amp;hellip; it can be a function of&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>3D space&lt;/li>
&lt;li>direction&lt;/li>
&lt;li>frequency&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Intensity itself is &lt;em>not&lt;/em> a vector quantity but it is a scalar field that &lt;em>is&lt;/em> function of direction. Draine and Rybicki and Lightman write the angular direction vector as \(\Omega\) and the solid angle surrounding that vector as \(\mathrm{d}\Omega\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we have a defined reference frame, we would probably write \(\Omega\) as a vector in spherical coordinates and define the components along \(\hat{\phi}\) and \(\hat{\theta}\) and let \(\mathrm{d}\Omega = d\phi \sin \theta d\theta\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\(B_\nu\) is exactly the same type of variable, we just use it instead of \(I_\nu\) when we&amp;rsquo;re referring to blackbody radiation, specifically of the form
$$
B_\nu = \frac{2 h \nu^3}{c^2}\frac{1}{e^{h \nu / kT} - 1}
$$
it also has units of
$$
\mathrm{ergs}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\;\mathrm{ster}^{-1}\;\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="flux">Flux&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Once you&amp;rsquo;ve defined \(I_\nu\), then it&amp;rsquo;s relatively easy to calculate quantities like energy density, flux, momentum, etc, as integrals of the specific intensity field.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="flux.png"

&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>$$
F_\nu = \int I_\nu \cos \theta d \Omega
$$
(intensity passing through some differential area \(dA\), lowered by the effective angle).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\(F_\nu\) has units of
$$
\mathrm{ergs}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\;\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}
$$
(i.e., angular dependence has been integrated out). I like using the unit of Jansky, which is
$$
1\,\mathrm{Jy} = 10^{-23} \mathrm{ergs}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\;\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In astronomy settings, \(F_\nu\) is called the &lt;em>spectral flux density&lt;/em>. In non-astronomy settings, this is called spectral irradiance. Sometimes you will see \(F_\lambda\), which has units
$$
\mathrm{ergs}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}
$$
(or per Å, depending on your wavelength range).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note that \(F_\nu\) and \(F_\lambda\) are flux &lt;em>densities&lt;/em> or distribution function, which means that
$$
F_\nu \ne F_\lambda
$$
(their units are different)!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is true is
$$
F_\nu \mathrm{d}\nu = F_\lambda \mathrm{d}\lambda
$$
because we&amp;rsquo;re comparing two quantities with units
$$
\mathrm{ergs}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You&amp;rsquo;ll sometimes also see a spectral energy distribution plotted
$$
F_\nu \nu = F_\lambda \lambda
$$
this comes about because
$$
\nu = \frac{c}{\lambda}
$$
$$
\frac{d \lambda}{d \nu} = -\frac{c}{\nu^2} = -\frac{\lambda}{\nu}
$$
and the minus sign goes away because fluxes are defined per &lt;em>positive&lt;/em> unit of frequency or wavelength.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I find the question of whether we&amp;rsquo;re referring to&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>\(I_\nu\): specific intensity (Jy/ster)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>\(F_\nu\): spectral flux density (Jy)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>\(F\): Bolometric flux \(\mathrm{ergs}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>to be endlessly confusing in conversation, because it&amp;rsquo;s very common to colloquially use &amp;ldquo;flux&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;brightness&amp;rdquo; to mean a range of quantities, even though they have specific definitions in many settings. I find the clearest thing is to state the variable \(I_\nu\) or \(F_\nu\) (or \(F_\lambda\)) &lt;em>and&lt;/em> the units.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="energy-density-and-photon-occupation-number">Energy density and photon occupation number&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &amp;ldquo;mean&amp;rdquo; (directionally averaged) intensity is
$$
J_\nu = \frac{1}{4 \pi} \int I_\nu d \Omega = \frac{1}{4\pi} \int I_\nu \sin \theta d \theta d\phi.
$$
it has a different meaning than flux. In an isotropic radiation field, the net flux will be 0, whereas the mean intensity will have some positive value.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and the mean radiation density is
$$
u_\nu = \frac{4 \pi}{c} J_\nu.
$$
these quantities &lt;em>are not&lt;/em> a function of direction, since we&amp;rsquo;ve averaged over it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a thermal, blackbody spectrum, we have
$$
u_\nu = \frac{4 \pi}{c} B_\nu(T)
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In equilibrium, the absorbers must have levels populated according to
$$
\frac{n_u}{n_l} = \frac{g_u}{g_l}e^{(E_l - E_u)/kT}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The following doesn&amp;rsquo;t depend on thermal equilibrium&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can also write down the photon occupation number \(n_\gamma\), i.e., a dimensionless quantity tracking how many photons exist &amp;ldquo;per given solid angle&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
n_\gamma = \frac{c^2}{2 h \nu^3} I_\nu
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>which we can average over all directions to get
$$
n_{\mathrm{bar},\gamma} = \frac{c^3}{8 \pi h \nu^3} u_\nu
$$
(a truly dimensionless quantity).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These photon occupation numbers make it easy to rewrite the transition rates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From \( u \rightarrow l\)
$$
\left ( \frac{dn_l}{dt}\right)= n_u A_{ul} (1 + n_{\mathrm{bar},\gamma})
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stimulated emission is not important when \( n_{\mathrm{bar},\gamma} \ll 1 \).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From \( l \rightarrow u\)
$$
\left ( \frac{d n_u}{dt} \right ) = n_l \frac{g_u}{g_l} A_{ul} n_{\mathrm{bar},\gamma}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="absorption-cross-section">Absorption cross section&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Because we&amp;rsquo;re talking about photons, instead of a velocity-dependent cross section, we will write a frequency-dependent cross section, \(\sigma(\nu)\). The velocity will be the speed of light \(c\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Photon density [1/cm^3] per unit frequency
$$
\frac{u_\nu}{h \nu}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Like in Ch 2, we would rate a rate as
$$
n_A n_B \langle \sigma v \rangle
$$
we&amp;rsquo;ll do the same thing with \(n_l\), \(\frac{u_\nu}{h \nu}\), and \(\sigma(\nu)\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the \(l \rightarrow u\) transition,
$$
\left ( \frac{d n_u}{d t} \right ) = n_l \int d \nu \sigma_{lu}(\nu) c \frac{u_\nu}{h \nu}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can relate this back to the Einstein B coefficient for absorption to find
$$
B_{lu} = \frac{c}{h \nu} \int d\nu \sigma_{lu}(\nu)
$$
relate this back to the \(A_{ul}\) coefficient,
$$
\int d_\nu \sigma_{lu}(\nu) = \frac{g_u}{g_l} \frac{c^2}{8 \pi \nu^2_{lu}} A_{ul}.
$$
Then solve for \(\sigma_{lu}(\nu)\)
$$
\sigma_{lu}(\nu) = \frac{g_u}{g_l} \frac{c^2}{8 \pi \nu^2_{lu}}A_{ul} \phi_\nu
$$
where \(\phi_\nu\) is a normalized line profile
$$
\int \phi_\nu d \nu = 1.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="oscillator-strength">Oscillator strength&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can also write these relationships with something called the oscillator strength, \(f_{lu}\).
$$
A_{ul} = \frac{8 \pi^2 e^2 \nu_{lu}^2}{m_e c^3} \frac{g_l}{g_u} f_{lu}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="intrinsic-line-profile">Intrinsic line profile&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A Lorentzian is a good description of the intrinsic line profile (need quantum mechanical calculation to get it exact).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\phi(\nu) = \frac{4 \gamma_{ul}}{16 \pi^2(\nu - \nu_{ul})^2 + \gamma_{ul}^2}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The intrinsic width of the absorption line reflects the uncertainty in the energies of levels \(l,u\) due to the finite lifetimes against transitions to other levels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Intrinsic widths of lines \(\propto h \nu\), which means x-ray transitions can have considerably larger line widths than radio transitions (assuming the medium is stationary).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll talk more about absorption line profiles, Doppler broadening, Voigt profiles, etc&amp;hellip; in a few lectures.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Energy Levels of Atoms, Ions, and Molecules</title><link>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/04-energy-levels-atoms/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/04-energy-levels-atoms/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://psu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/Astro+542A+Lecture+4A+Aug+30/1_7cregjt3">Zoom link&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;li>O I = neutral oxygen&lt;/li>
&lt;li>O II = singly ionized oxygen&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ne III = doubly ionized neon&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Sometimes, you may see the more conventional &amp;ldquo;chemical&amp;rdquo; notation when we&amp;rsquo;re just referring to the ion, i.e., \(\mathrm{Ne}^{4+}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="single-electron-orbitals">Single-Electron orbitals&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>\(n\) principal quantum number (electron energy or &amp;ldquo;shell&amp;rdquo; level). You may see these labeled using K, L, M for \(n=1,2,3\)&amp;hellip;, especially if you do x-ray science.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>\(l\) orbital angular momentum in units of \(\hbar\) (orbital type, &lt;em>s, p, d, f&lt;/em> corresponding to \(l=0,1,2,3\)). Letters themselves are a holdover from pre-quantum empirical lab studies.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>For given \(n\), \(l\) can take on values \(0 \leq l &amp;lt; n\).&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>\(m_l\) (Drain calls it \(m_z\)) is the projection of orbital angular momentum onto the \(z\) axis and called the &amp;ldquo;magnetic&amp;rdquo; quantum number. If no applied magnetic field, energy for two \(m_l\) values are the same. Can take on \(2l + 1\) different values: \(m_l = -l, \ldots, -1, 0, 1, \dots l\).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>\(m_s\) is the projection of spin onto the \(z\) axis. Electrons are spin \(1/2\) particles, so projection only takes on two values. Degenerate energies if no applied field.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>So a given pair of quantum numbers \(nl\) refers to \(2(2l + 1)\) distinct wavefunctions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="pauli-exclusion-principal">Pauli exclusion principal&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Two electrons cannot share the same wavefunction.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>each \(nl\) subshell can have at most \(2(2l + 1)\) electrons&lt;/li>
&lt;li>\(s = 2\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>\(p = 6\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>\(d = 10\)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>\(f = 14\)&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The spectral lines we observe are most commonly the result of the interactions among the electrons in the outermost shell, called the &amp;ldquo;optically active&amp;rdquo; electrons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are three relevant vectors and corresponding quantum numbers&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>\(\boldsymbol{L}\) is total orbital angular momentum of electrons in outermost shell, with corresponding quantum number \(m_L = \sum m_l\), the projection of the &lt;em>total&lt;/em> orbital angular momentum \(L \hbar\) onto the \(z\)-axis.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>\(\boldsymbol{S}\) is the total spin angular momentum of the electrons in the shell, and has an associated quantum number \(m_S = \sum m_s\), the projection of the &lt;em>total&lt;/em> spin angular momentum \( S \hbar\) onto the z-axis.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>\(\boldsymbol{J} = \boldsymbol{L} + \boldsymbol{S}\) is the total (orbital + spin) angular momentum of the electrons. This term arises because of the coupling between the orbital and spin angular momentum, called the L-S coupling.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="permitted-semi-forbidden-and-forbidden-radiative-transitions">Permitted, semi-forbidden, and forbidden radiative transitions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Dipole selection rules determine whether a transition is &amp;ldquo;permitted&amp;rdquo; or not.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Semi-forbidden&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;forbidden&amp;rdquo; radiative transitions are not &lt;em>strictly&lt;/em> forbidden. It&amp;rsquo;s just that their transition probabilities (Einstein A coefficients) are much smaller than permitted lines (with forbidden lines being less likely still).&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Semi-forbidden \(\mathrm{O\,III}],\lambda1666 \)Å&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Forbidden \([\mathrm{O\,III}],\lambda5007 \)Å&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In terrestrial settings, it&amp;rsquo;s more likely that an atom will be collisionally de-excited than emit in said transition. So it&amp;rsquo;s more accurate to call these &amp;ldquo;terrestrially-forbidden&amp;rdquo; transitions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="hyperfine-structure">Hyperfine Structure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>If the nucleus has a non-zero magnetic moment, the interaction of the magnetic fields of the nucleus and electrons gives rise to a small energy difference, which is called hyperfine structure. The hyperfine quantum number is
$$
\boldsymbol{F} = \boldsymbol{I} + \boldsymbol{J}
$$
where \(\boldsymbol{I}\) is the quantized spin angular momentum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most famous of these is the 21.106 cm line of neutral hydrogen (H I), i.e., the &amp;ldquo;21-cm&amp;rdquo; line, corresponding to the electron &amp;ldquo;spin-flip.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But see also the hyperfine lines of HCN and \(\mathrm{C}_2 \mathrm{H}\) in protoplanetary disks.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="molecular-spectroscopy">Molecular Spectroscopy&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Molecular spectroscopy is hard&lt;/em>. But worthwhile. Why is molecular spectroscopy hard? Having two (or more) atoms destroys the nice symmetry that we had with atomic spectra. This means that there are &lt;em>many more&lt;/em> ways for a molecule to move, which means many more degrees of freedom, which means many more quantum states to transition between and thus many more discrete photon energies to emit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most abundant, astrophysically-interesting molecules are diatomic molecules (having two atoms). Thankfully, this means we at least have a line of rotational symmetry along the &lt;em>internuclear axis&lt;/em>, the line from one nucleus to another.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>homonuclear: having the same nucleus (e.g., \(H_2\), \(O_2\))&lt;/li>
&lt;li>heteronuclear: having different nuclei (e.g., \(HD\), \(CO\) )&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The main types of molecular transitions that you will encounter in astrophysical contexts are either vibrational or rotational.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="vibrational-transitions">Vibrational Transitions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Due to the quantization of the vibrational energy as atoms stretch on the internuclear axis.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Ground state is very near the bottom (but not completely so).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Can be approximated as a &lt;em>harmonic oscillator&lt;/em> with quantum number \(v\), and vibrational energy levels
$$
E_\mathrm{vib}(v) = \hbar \omega_0 (v + 1/2).
$$
where
$$
\omega_0 = \sqrt{k/m_r}
$$
where in this case only, \(k\) is the spring constant for the harmonic oscillator. \(m_r\) is the reduced mass
$$
m_r = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Typical vibrational energies \(\hbar \omega_0\) range from 0.2 - 0.5 eV, corresponding to spectral lines in the infrared.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even at the ground vibrational state (\(v =0\), a molecule still has a zero point energy

E_\mathrm{rot}(J) = \frac{\hbar}{2I}J(J +1)

&lt;p>Moment of inertia given by
$$
I = m_1 r_1^2 + m_2 r_2^2 = \mu R^2

&lt;p>One would specify a transition using a combination of quantum numbers, like

a purely rotational transition.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="electronic-transitions">Electronic transitions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Molecules can also have electronic transitions (i.e., w/ electrons), just like in atoms. And these typically have energies of a few eV and produce spectral lines in UV, optical and near-IR. Generally, though, when we&amp;rsquo;re talking about observations of (diatomic) molecular spectra, we&amp;rsquo;re usually dealing with rotational (radio) and sometimes vibrational (IR) transitions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamic Equilibrium</title><link>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/03-stat-mech/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/03-stat-mech/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://psu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/Astro+542A+Lecture+3+Aug+27/1_jxunbxmk">Zoom link&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Draine Ch. 3&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also good review is &amp;ldquo;An Introduction to Thermal Physics&amp;rdquo; by Daniel V. Schroeder, esp. Ch 6 &amp;ldquo;Boltzmann Statistics.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>The ISM and IGM are generally far from thermodynamic equilibrium&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, to understand the nonequilibrium conditions, we first need to understand the equilibrium conditions, which are useful for relating forward and reverse reaction rates of ionization and recombination processes important to the ISM.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Local thermodynamic equilibrium: emission properties can be calculated from measured properties and temperature. Key point is that we can define temperature &lt;em>and&lt;/em> it has some bearing on the microphysics of the fluid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, LTE exists in a glass of water containing a melting ice cube. Temperature can be defined at any point, and if the energies of the molecules at a specific point are measured, they will follow a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution with that temperature (Wikipedia).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>LTE also exists in the photospheres of stars.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="partition-functions">Partition functions&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The partition function \(Z\) is a dimensionless number describing a physical system, e.g., some set of particles in a box with volume \(V\). It allows you to understand the macrostates of the system from the microstates of the system.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you know the partition function, you can calculate energy, pressure, magnetization, entropy, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a classical discrete system, the partition function is
$$
Z(T) = \sum_s e^{- E(s)/kT}
$$
sum is over all possible states \(s\) of the system, and \(E(s)\) is the energy of state \(s\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a continuous system, the partition function is expressed using an integral (since the set of microstates as a function of position and momentum is infinite)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
Z(X, T) = \frac{V}{h^3} \int_0^\infty 4 \pi p^2 \, \mathrm{d}p \; e^{-p^2/2 M_x k T}
$$
where \(M_X\) is the mass of the particle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For dilute gases, we generally need to talk about both types of partition functions, since the gas particles can have both translational motion and internal energy (i.e., quantum states)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
Z(T) = Z_\mathrm{tran}(T) z_\mathrm{int}(T)
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>the translational partition function is&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
Z_\mathrm{tran} = \frac{(2 \pi M_X k T)^{3/2}}{h^3} V
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The internal partition function is a sum over the possible internal states of \(X\)
$$
z_\mathrm{int}(X; T) = \sum_i g_i e^{E_i/kT}
$$
where \(g_i\) is the degeneracy of level \(i\), or the number of quantum states grouped together in the same energy level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, a free electron has just two internal states (spin up and down), both of which have \(E_i = 0\), so \(z_\mathrm{int} = 2\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, we will define the &lt;em>partition function per unit volume&lt;/em>
$$
f(X; T) = \frac{Z}{V} = \left [ \frac{(2 \pi M_X k T)^{3/2}}{h^3} \right] z_\mathrm{int}(X; T)
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="detailed-balance-law-of-mass-action">Detailed balance: law of mass action&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Suppose there is a chemical reaction \(A + B \leftrightarrow C\), which is in &lt;strong>local thermodynamic equilibrium&lt;/strong>. Statistical mechanics tells us that the LTE abundance of species \(X\) is proportional to \(f(X)\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And therefore the number densities of the species satisfy the law of mass action&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\frac{n_C}{n_A n_B} = \frac{f(C)}{f(A) f(B)}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, in LTE, the ratio of the product of number densities is equal to the ratio of the product of partition functions
$$
\frac{\prod_i n_{\mathrm{left},i}}{\prod_i n_{\mathrm{right},i}} = \frac{\prod_i f_{\mathrm{left},i}}{\prod_i f_{\mathrm{right},i}}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>more details in Draine 3.2.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As we mentioned, the partition function is useful for describing the macrostates of the system. If we want to find the ratio of number densities of a species, then we can just use the ratio of the partition functions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ionization-and-recombination">Ionization and Recombination&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s apply this understanding to the case of recombination and ionization, where an electron recombines with an ionized atom, moving its energy level in the process
$$
e^- + X_u^{+r +1} \leftrightarrow X_l^{+r}
$$
Say we know the abundance of \(X_u^{+r+1}\) and \(n_e\), that the system is in LTE, and the energies of the two states (\(E_{r,l}\) and \(E_{r+1, u}\)). What is the abundance of \(X_l^{+r}\)?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s remember our left-hand-side / right-hand-side balance&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\frac{n(X_l^{+r})}{n(X_u^{+r+1})n(e^-)} = \frac{z_{\mathrm{int},\mathrm{X_l^{+r}}}}{z_{\mathrm{int},\mathrm{X_u^{+r+1}}}z_{\mathrm{int},\mathrm{e^-}}}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We just calculated \(z_{\mathrm{int},\mathrm{e^-}}\), and its 2. So we have&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
n(X_l^{+r}) = n(X_u^{+r+1})n(e^-) \frac{1}{2} \left ( \frac{z_{\mathrm{int},\mathrm{X_l^{+r}}}}{z_{\mathrm{int},\mathrm{X_u^{+r+1}}}} \right )
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>looking back to the partition function definition, the bracketed term is (relatively) easy to calculate, because we only have a single energy level under consideration for each species (no sum)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\frac{z_{\mathrm{int},\mathrm{X_l^{+r}}}}{z_{\mathrm{int},\mathrm{X_u^{+r+1}}}} = \frac{g(X_l^{+r}) e^{-E_{r,l}/kT}}{g(X_u^{+r+1}) e^{-E_{r+1,u}/kT}}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and there, we&amp;rsquo;ve solved for \(n(X_l^{+r})\).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="saha-equation">Saha Equation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Bengali physicist Meghnad Saha in 1920. Combining ideas of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics to explain spectral classification of stars. Is the reason why we see drastically different spectral absorption lines in stars as a function of temperature, even though all stars are majority hydrogen composition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Lets expand the previous example by considering all energy levels of \(X^{+r}\) and \(X^{+r+1}\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
e^- + X^{+r +1} \leftrightarrow X^{+r}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>same thing with the left-hand-side / right-hand-side balance, only though now we need to consider all levels&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\frac{n(X^{+r})}{n(X^{+r+1})n(e^-)} = \frac{z_{\mathrm{int},\mathrm{X^{+r}}}}{z_{\mathrm{int},\mathrm{X^{+r+1}}}z_{\mathrm{int},\mathrm{e^-}}}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>which means we need to consider all levels in the partition function calculation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\frac{z_{\mathrm{int},\mathrm{X^{+r}}}}{z_{\mathrm{int},\mathrm{X^{+r+1}}}} = \frac{\sum_j g_{r,j} e^{-E_{r,j}/kT}}{\sum_j g_{r+1,j} e^{-E_{r+1,j}/kT}}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If the temperature is sufficiently low that only the lowest energy level states are significant in the calculation of the partition function (\(e^{-E_i/kT}\)). If \(T\) is large, then \(e^{-E_i/kT} \rightarrow 0\) as \(E_i\) increases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let the ionization energy be given by
$$
\Phi_r = E_{r+1,1} - E_{r,1}
$$
then the Saha equation is
$$
\frac{n(e^-) n(X^{+r+1})}{n(X^{+r})} \approx \frac{2(2 \pi m_e kT)^{3/2}}{h^3} \frac{g_{r+1,1}}{g_{r,1}}e^{-\Phi_r/kT}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>again, all of this is assuming &lt;em>local thermodynamic equilibrium&lt;/em>. Good for stellar interiors, but &lt;em>not&lt;/em> a good approximation in the ISM or IGM.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ratios-of-rate-coefficients">Ratios of rate coefficients&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Assuming we are in local thermodynamic equilibrium and that the reaction is in equilibrium, how can we use the law of mass action to calculate the ratio of rate coefficients?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider the inelastic scattering reaction
$$
X(l) + Y \rightarrow X(u) + Y
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since we are in LTE, you can think of there being a &amp;ldquo;bath&amp;rdquo; of species \(Y\) that, given the opportunity, will react with &lt;em>both&lt;/em> \(X(l)\) and \(X(u)\). Assume \(Y\) is a collisional partner that does not change internal state during the interaction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What do we know from law of mass action?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\frac{n(X(u)) n(Y)}{n(X(l))n(Y)} = \frac{f(X(u))f(Y)}{f(X(l))f(Y)} = \frac{z_\mathrm{int}(X(u))}{z_\mathrm{int}(X(l))}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What do we know from conservation of mass?
$$
n(X(u)) n(Y) \langle \sigma v \rangle_{l \rightarrow u} = n(X(u)) n(Y) \langle \sigma v \rangle_{u \rightarrow l}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Rearrange these to find
$$
\frac{\langle \sigma v \rangle_{l \rightarrow u}}{\langle \sigma v \rangle_{u \rightarrow l}} = \frac{z_\mathrm{int}(X(u))}{z_\mathrm{int}(X(l))} = \frac{g_u}{g_l} e^{-(E_u - E_l)/kT}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>More info in Draine 3.5.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These relationships can also be used to put conditions on the ratios of cross sections. See Draine 3.6 for more details.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="three-body-recombination">Three body recombination&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Can be important for hydrogen recombination, especially higher energy levels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
H^+ + e^- + e^- \rightarrow H(n) + e^-
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Draine 3.7 has some calculations for this, the interesting result being that the number density \(n(H(n)) \propto n^2\). You can think of this as one electron loosing just enough energy to become bound at a higher energy level.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="departure-coefficients">Departure coefficients&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Draine 3.8&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The departure coefficient is the ratio of the actual number density to the number density if one were in LTE&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
b_n \equiv \frac{n[H(n)]}{n_\mathrm{LTE}[H(n)]}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If we were &lt;em>only&lt;/em> considering collisional processes like collisional ionization and three-body recombination, then \(b_n = 1\). Important to recognize that &lt;em>collisions&lt;/em> do the thermalization that brings a parcel of gas into LTE. This is why most higher density things can be assumed to be in LTE (Sun&amp;rsquo;s photosphere, earth&amp;rsquo;s atmosphere, regions of protoplanetary disks, etc&amp;hellip;) but we can get in trouble when we go to less dense regions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In less dense regions, the excited states can be depopulated by &lt;em>spontaneous emission&lt;/em> at rates comparable or exceeding collisional dexcitation (or recombination). The spontaneous emission rate is larger for smaller \(n\), yielding the following plot for hydrogen atoms&lt;/p>

&lt;p>High \(n\) levels are interesting things. Transitions from
$$
n + 1 \rightarrow 1
$$
principal states are called \(n\alpha\) transitions. E.g., Lyman \(\alpha\) is the \(1\alpha\) transition.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When \(n\) becomes very large, the photon is in the radio band of the spectrum, and these are called &amp;ldquo;radio recombination lines.&amp;rdquo; E.g., we might talk about the \(166\alpha\) or \(159\alpha\) transitions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The curve of \(b_n(n)\) also sets up conditions so that &lt;em>maser amplification&lt;/em> can occur.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Collisional Processes</title><link>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/02-collisional-processes/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://iancze.github.io/courses/astro542/lectures/02-collisional-processes/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://psu.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/Astro+542A+Lecture+2+Aug+25/1_gp4w3at4">Zoom link&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>We can write the (average) reaction rate per unit volume (units \(\mathrm{cm}^{-3} \mathrm{s}^{-1}\)) as&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
n_A n_B \langle \sigma v \rangle_{AB}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>i.e., the rate is proportional to the number density of each species and the &lt;strong>two-body collisional rate coefficient&lt;/strong>, \( \langle \sigma v \rangle_{AB} \), which has units of \(\mathrm{cm}^3 \mathrm{s}^{-1}\). Once you know the rate coefficient, this is a pretty simple relationship, just multiplying terms together. But let&amp;rsquo;s unpack how we calculate the rate coefficient.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do we calculate this coefficient?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, let&amp;rsquo;s consider the cross-section of the reaction&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>$$
\sigma = \frac{1}{n \lambda}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>where \(n\) is number density and \(\lambda\) is the mean free path. Generally, \(\sigma \) can be thought of as the cross-sectional area (hence the name) for the interaction, and it has units of area (\(\mathrm{cm}^2\)), just like a cross-section of a solid. I.e., if the cross-section of the spheres are larger, then they&amp;rsquo;re more likely to hit each other (interact). However, if the cross-section is very small, it&amp;rsquo;s unlikely that they&amp;rsquo;ll hit each other (interact).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the types of interactions we&amp;rsquo;re talking about, the cross-section of the interaction can be dependent on the relative velocity between the particles, \(\sigma(v)\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a gas, what can we generally say about the distribution of velocities of the particles? For a fluid in thermal equilibrium, the distribution function of the relative speed of encounters between particles is given by a Maxwellian velocity distribution&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
f_v \, \mathrm{d}v = 4 \pi \left (\frac{\mu}{2 \pi k_B T }\right)^{3/2} \exp(- \mu v^2/2 k_B T) \, v^2 \mathrm{d} v
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>where
$$
\mu = \frac{m_A m_B}{m_A + m_B}
$$
is the reduced mass of the collisional partners. \(f_v\) is a distribution function, so to find the fraction of encounters that have relative speeds \(v_a &amp;lt; v &amp;lt; v_b\), we would just need to integrate over the relevant range
$$
\int_{v_a}^{v_b} f_v \, \mathrm{d}v,
$$
and to find the average value (i.e., expectation value) of some quantity \(X(v)\), we&amp;rsquo;d do
$$
\langle X \rangle = \int_{0}^{\infty} X(v) f_v \, \mathrm{d}v.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Getting back to the original goal, we want to calculate the &lt;strong>two-body collisional rate coefficient&lt;/strong>, \( \langle \sigma v \rangle_{AB} \), where \(X = \sigma v \). The cross section \(\sigma\) is a function of velocity \(\sigma(v)\), so we have \(X = \sigma(v) v \), or
$$
\langle \sigma v \rangle_{AB} = \int_0^\infty \sigma_{AB}(v) v f_v \, \mathrm{d}v.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Following Draine (S2.1), we can also do a change of variables to center of mass energy \(E = \mu v^2/2\) to make the calculations more convenient.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three-body collisions may be important in some situations, such as for populating the high-\(n\) levels of hydrogen. Their reaction rate is
$$
k_{ABC} n_A n_B n_C
$$
where \(k_{ABC}\) is the three-body collisional rate coefficient.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="inverse-square-law-forces">Inverse-Square Law Forces&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s consider the scattering by two particles interacting through an inverse square law \(1/r^2\), called Rutherford or Coulomb Scattering.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="question-time">Question time&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>How can we quickly get an estimate of the &lt;em>momentum&lt;/em> transferred between two particles when they interact?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are some quick ways we could estimate this? If we needed to be very accurate, what would we need to do?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="impact-approximation">Impact approximation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>A proper treatment involves some tedious integrals (see the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_section_(physics)#Differential_cross_section">Wikipedia article&lt;/a> for reference), but we can get to an order-of-magnitude estimate using the &amp;ldquo;impact approximation.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>

&lt;p>$$
F_{12} = \frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{r^2}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="super-simple-way">Super simple way&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Change in momentum is an &lt;em>impulse&lt;/em>,
$$
\Delta p = F \Delta t = m \Delta v.
$$
And we&amp;rsquo;ll calculate the impulse given by the product of the perpendicular force at closest approach times the characteristic interaction time. This is likely to be the &amp;ldquo;most wrong&amp;rdquo; calculation, but it should at least get us in the ball park in terms of order of magnitude.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The instantaneous force perpendicular to the trajectory is
$$
F_\bot = \frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{(b \cos \theta)^2} \cos \theta = \frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{b^2} \cos^3 \theta
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What is &amp;ldquo;characteristic time&amp;rdquo; for the interaction? A decent guess is \(b/v_1\). Then the change in momentum is just&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\Delta p = \frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{b v_1}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A (slightly) more thorough treatment in the textbook (Draine 2.2.1) yields a more accurate
$$
\Delta p = 2 \frac{Z_1 Z_2 e^2}{b v_1}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Great, how can we use this to estimate things relevant to the ISM, such as the ionization rate of an atom with a single bound electron?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="collisional-ionization">Collisional Ionization&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Let \(I\) be the energy required to ionize the atom, i.e., completely unbind the electron.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will consider the ionizer to be (another) electron that is moving fast enough such that its kinetic energy is \(\gg I\). If we could &lt;em>directly&lt;/em> translate this energy to unbinding the electron, it would. But, we&amp;rsquo;re considering glancing (and more distant) interactions, so it&amp;rsquo;s not immediately clear how much we&amp;rsquo;d transfer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If \(b\) is small, more energy will transferred. If \(b\) is large, less energy will be transferred. There will be some \(b\) so large that an insufficient amount of energy will be transferred to unbind the electron and ionize the atom. Let&amp;rsquo;s use our impact approximation to calculate this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The criterion is
$$
\frac{(\Delta p)^2}{2 m_e} &amp;gt; I
$$
i.e., transfers of momentum exceedingFy the ionization energy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We use this and the \(\Delta p\) equation above to solve for a maximum impact parameter&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
b_\mathrm{max} = \left [ \frac{2 Z_p^2 e^4}{m_e v^2 I} \right ]^{1/2}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can use the impact parameter as the &amp;ldquo;radius&amp;rdquo; of the cross-section, therefore the cross-section area for an ionizing interaction is
$$
\sigma(v) \approx \pi b_\mathrm{max}^2(v).
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we calculate the thermal rate coefficient
$$
\langle \sigma v \rangle = \int_{v_\mathrm{min}}^\infty \sigma(v) v f_v \, \mathrm{d}v.
$$
\(f_v\) is still given by the Maxwellian distribution, so we have
$$
\langle \sigma v \rangle = Z_p^2 \left (\frac{8 \pi}{m_e kT} \right)^{1/2} \frac{e^4}{I}e^{-I/kT}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a hydrogen atom, the ionization energy is
$$
I = \frac{13.602}{n^2} \, [\mathrm{eV}]
$$
where \(n\) is the principal quantum number. For highly excited energy (\(n \approx 100\)), the ionization energy becomes small and the collisional ionization rate becomes very large.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="electron-ion-inelastic-scattering-collisional-strength-omega_ul">Electron-ion inelastic scattering: Collisional strength \(\Omega_{ul}\)&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We just discussed elastic scattering of electrons by ions, whereby momentum transfer between the two is dominated by &amp;ldquo;distant&amp;rdquo; encounters with impact parameters much larger than the relevant scales of the atom.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When the fast-moving electron &lt;em>does&lt;/em> pass very close to the atom with bound electron, however, quantum mechanics plays a role (as it always does&amp;hellip;) and the bound electron may transition to another energetically allowed state.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s common to write the cross-section for these interactions using a dimensionless quantity \(\Omega_{ul}\) called the collision strength. You can see S 2.3 of Draine for the full details, but the important part is that
$$
\langle \sigma v \rangle_{u \rightarrow l} \propto \frac{\Omega_{ul}}{g_u \sqrt{T}}.
$$
The good news is that&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>\(\Omega_{ul}\) is approximately indepedent of \(T\) for temperatures below 10,000 K&lt;/li>
&lt;li>typical values of \(\Omega_{ul}\) are 1 - 10&lt;/li>
&lt;li>this means collisional rate coefficient \(\langle \sigma v \rangle_{u \rightarrow l}\) is \(\propto T^{-1/2}\)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Inelastic collisions play a role in line radiation from hot gas, since they leave the atom in an excited state, from which it decays by emitting a photon.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ion-neutral-collision-rates">Ion-Neutral Collision Rates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A charged ion particle (more than just an electron) interacting with neutral particles (atoms or molecules). If the two are separated by more than a few Å, the charged particle creates an electric field \(\vec{E}\) which &lt;em>polarizes&lt;/em> the neutral.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the case of a simple hydrogen atom, you can think of this as the proton and electron moving to separate sides. The neutral acquires a dipole moment \(\vec{P} = \alpha_N \vec{E}\), where \(\alpha_N\) is the polarizability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This creates an interaction potential which looks like
$$
U(r) = -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\alpha_N Z^2 e^2}{r^4}.
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interactions in this potential are interesting.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="fig_2_2.jpg"

&lt;p>Three trajectories in a \(1/r^4\) potential. Attribution: Draine Figure 2.2&lt;/p>
&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>When \(b &amp;lt; b_0\), the charged particle can undergo an &amp;ldquo;orbiting&amp;rdquo; trajectory, which has cross section for interaction \(\pi b_0^2\). If you do the math, this unique cross section leads to a rate coefficient \(\langle \sigma v \rangle\) that is independent of temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>See Draine Table 2.1 for a list of Ion-Neutral scattering parameters. We&amp;rsquo;re talking about neutrals like H, He, \(\mathrm{H}_2\), and O, and ions like \(H^+, C^+, \mathrm{H}_2^+\).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Orbiting trajectories bring ion and neutral into close contact, and if there is an energetically allowed outcome&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>collisional dexcitation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>exothermic charge exchange&lt;/li>
&lt;li>chemical exchange reaction
and the reaction rate coefficients for these reactions become comparable to the orbiting rate coefficient.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Because the rate coefficients are independent of temperature (all others we&amp;rsquo;ve examined &lt;em>are&lt;/em> dependent on temperature), exothermic ion-neutral reactions play a major role in chemistry of &lt;em>cool&lt;/em> interstellar gas.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="electron-neutral-collision-rates">Electron-Neutral Collision Rates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Elastic scattering of electrons by neutrals. Can be important in &lt;em>very low ionization&lt;/em> environments (e.g., protoplanetary disks). Primary collision partner is \(H_2\). Rates are determined experimentally.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="neutral-neutral-collision-rates">Neutral-Neutral Collision Rates&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Interactions between two neutral species&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>at small separations is repulsive&lt;/li>
&lt;li>at larger separations is attractive (van der Waals) \(U(r) \propto r^{-6}\)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The fact that attractive interaction is very weak and the onset of repulsive interaction sufficiently rapid that we can treat the two partners as &amp;ldquo;hard spheres,&amp;rdquo; i.e., the cross-sectional area is really just the characteristic size of the atom or molecule (~1 Å). Think of throwing two basketballs at each other. They will only interact if \(b &amp;lt; R_1 + R_2\), i.e., if the balls would hit each other. No need to consider effective cross sectional area for charges. For temperatures less than 100 K, the rate coefficient for neutral-neutral scattering is more than 10x smaller than the rate coefficient for ion-neutral scattering.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Interstellar medium course is at once a course about nothing and a course about everything. What I mean by that is we&amp;rsquo;re talking about the &lt;em>space between things&lt;/em>, some of the least dense parts of the galaxy. But we&amp;rsquo;re also going to touch on nearly all aspects of astrophysics:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>quantum mechanics of atoms and molecules&lt;/li>
&lt;li>radiative transfer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>star formation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>planet formation&lt;/li>
&lt;li>galactic stellar populations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>and even cosmology (slightly)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s because this course is fundamentally about the interactions between all of these more easily-defined &amp;ldquo;units&amp;rdquo; of astrophysics. The science lectures in this course will basically fall into one or two categories:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>coverage/review of fundamental concepts/theories (e.g., quantum mechanics, radiative transfer, etc&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>applying/integrating those concepts to understanding the interstellar medium (e.g., dust emission, star formation, etc&amp;hellip;)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll be talking about many fundamental astrophysical concepts in some detail (warning: not as much detail as courses designed to cover these subjects, but enough detail so that you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to follow along if you haven&amp;rsquo;t taken these courses already, or if you forgot)!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-a-graduate-course">What is a graduate course?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Compared to undergraduate courses, graduate courses are one step closer to operating at the interface between established knowledge and full-blown research. Graduate courses try to distill (sometimes very recently gained) knowledge into an &lt;em>efficient&lt;/em> format for learning. Or, at least, a more efficient format than the alternative, which would be trying to assemble the knowledge oneself through reading various scientific articles. At the end of your Ph.D., you&amp;rsquo;ll look back on the series of papers you&amp;rsquo;ve written and the talks you&amp;rsquo;ve given at various conferences, and you&amp;rsquo;ll have your own set of new discoveries and topics that you know in better detail than nearly everyone else on this planet. Now, the question is, how can you efficiently teach a new generation the core concepts? That&amp;rsquo;s essentially what a graduate course is trying to do.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="ism-nomenclature">ISM nomenclature&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Throughout this course we will be frequently discussing neutral atomic hydrogen, ionized atomic hydrogen (i.e., protons), and (neutral )molecular hydrogen. Atomic spectroscopists denote ionization states with Roman numerals, with &lt;strong>I&lt;/strong> corresponding to the neutral case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take Calcium, for example. Neutral Calcium is Ca I, singly ionized Calcium is Ca II, and five-times ionized Calcium is Ca IV.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Neutral Hydrogen: H I&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Singly-ionized Hydrogen (i.e., a proton): H II&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Molecular Hydrogen: \(H_2\)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When we say &amp;ldquo;H two,&amp;rdquo; which do we mean? In this course, at least, we&amp;rsquo;ll strive to maintain the convention that H II &lt;code>==&lt;/code> &amp;ldquo;H two,&amp;rdquo; and when we are referring to \(H_2\), we will say &amp;ldquo;molecular hydrogen.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ISM is mostly hydrogen. Hydrogen states by mass (following Draine Table 1.2).&lt;/p>
&lt;div id='vis'>&lt;/div>

vegaEmbed('#vis', spec).then(function (result) {

&lt;/script>
&lt;h2 id="phases-of-the-ism">Phases of the ISM&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Why does it matter that we have a clear distinction between the forms of Hydrogen? Because Hydrogen is the most abundant element (cosmologically speaking), and these trace the phases of the ISM.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What do we mean by phases of the ISM? Broadly speaking, these are characteristic states of the baryons in the ISM. Different authors will make different levels of distinction, i.e., &amp;ldquo;two-phase&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;three-phase&amp;rdquo; ISM. In the case of Draine (Table 1.3), we have seven phases. In the case of Ryden and Pogge, we have five phases. Recognize that ultimately the &amp;ldquo;phases&amp;rdquo; are a continuum of states, and that it makes sense to group things into phases based upon the physical processes that occur with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Don&amp;rsquo;t worry too much about the exact boundaries of each phase, but instead focus on the huge, &lt;em>orders of magnitude&lt;/em> range in densities, temperatures, and volume fractions. If you wanted to chose a most-important phase based on &lt;em>volume&lt;/em>, you&amp;rsquo;re going to get a different answer than if you chose one based on &lt;em>mass&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For now, let&amp;rsquo;s just reflect on Draine Table 1.3 / Ryden and Pogge Table 1.1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We see combinations of &lt;em>temperature&lt;/em>, &lt;em>density&lt;/em>, and &lt;em>ionization state&lt;/em>. The point of this course is basically understanding the interaction between these phases. Following Draine,&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Coronal gas, &amp;ldquo;hot ionized medium&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;HIM&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>H II gas, dense H II regions, diffuse H II regions, &amp;ldquo;warm ionized medium&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;WIM&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Warm H I, &amp;ldquo;warm neutral medium&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;WNM&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cool H I, &amp;ldquo;cold neutral medium&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;CNM&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Diffuse molecular gas&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Dense molecular gas&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Stellar outflows&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Ryden and Pogge lump all molecular gas together, and don&amp;rsquo;t differentiate stellar outflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The ISM is dynamic, and baryons in each of these phases can change into others. Ionizing photons will turn cold molecular gas to hot ionized hydrogen (HII); hot gas can cool to lower temperatures through radiative cooling; ions and electrons can recombine into atoms, and atoms can recombine to form \(H_2\) molecules.&lt;/p>
