Some of this lecture will likely be review from your quantum mechanics (and/or chemistry) courses. The goal is to revisit and organize our understanding of the energy levels of atoms, ions, and molecules to form a foundation for later astrophysical processes that use these emission/absorption lines."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.134.2"><title>Energy Levels of Atoms, Ions, and Molecules | Czekala Group</title>

You may see these labeled using K, L, M for \(n=1,2,3\)&mldr;, especially if you do x-ray science.</li><li>\(l\) orbital angular momentum in units of \(\hbar\) (orbital type, <em>s, p, d, f</em> corresponding to \(l=0,1,2,3\)). Letters themselves are a holdover from pre-quantum empirical lab studies.</li></ul><p>For given \(n\), \(l\) can take on values \(0 \leq l &lt; n\).</p><ul><li>\(m_l\) (Drain calls it \(m_z\)) is the projection of orbital angular momentum onto the \(z\) axis and called the &ldquo;magnetic&rdquo; quantum number. If no applied magnetic field, energy for two \(m_l\) values are the same. Can take on \(2l + 1\) different values: \(m_l = -l, \ldots, -1, 0, 1, \dots l\).</li><li>\(m_s\) is the projection of spin onto the \(z\) axis. Electrons are spin \(1/2\) particles, so projection only takes on two values. Degenerate energies if no applied field.</li></ul><p>So a given pair of quantum numbers \(nl\) refers to \(2(2l + 1)\) distinct wavefunctions.</p><h2 id=pauli-exclusion-principal>Pauli exclusion principal</h2><p>Two electrons cannot share the same wavefunction.</p><ul><li>each \(nl\) subshell can have at most \(2(2l + 1)\) electrons</li><li>\(s = 2\)</li><li>\(p = 6\)</li><li>\(d = 10\)</li><li>\(f = 14\)</li></ul><figure><a href=https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_%28Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry%29/Quantum_Mechanics/09._The_Hydrogen_Atom/Atomic_Theory/Electrons_in_Atoms/Electronic_Orbitals><img src=/courses/astro542/lectures/04-energy-levels-atoms/Single_electron_orbitals.jpg alt="Visualization of the electron orbitals.

$$</p><h2 id=spectroscopic-terms>Spectroscopic terms</h2><p>The spectral lines we observe are most commonly the result of the interactions among the electrons in the outermost shell, called the &ldquo;optically active&rdquo; electrons.</p><p>There are three relevant vectors and corresponding quantum numbers</p><ul><li>\(\boldsymbol{L}\) is total orbital angular momentum of electrons in outermost shell, with corresponding quantum number \(m_L = \sum m_l\), the projection of the <em>total</em> orbital angular momentum \(L \hbar\) onto the \(z\)-axis.</li><li>\(\boldsymbol{S}\) is the total spin angular momentum of the electrons in the shell, and has an associated quantum number \(m_S = \sum m_s\), the projection of the <em>total</em> spin angular momentum \( S \hbar\) onto the z-axis.</li><li>\(\boldsymbol{J} = \boldsymbol{L} + \boldsymbol{S}\) is the total (orbital + spin) angular momentum of the electrons. This term arises because of the coupling between the orbital and spin angular momentum, called the L-S coupling.</li></ul><h2 id=permitted-semi-forbidden-and-forbidden-radiative-transitions>Permitted, semi-forbidden, and forbidden radiative transitions</h2><p>Dipole selection rules determine whether a transition is &ldquo;permitted&rdquo; or not.</p><p>&ldquo;Semi-forbidden&rdquo; and &ldquo;forbidden&rdquo; radiative transitions are not <em>strictly</em> forbidden. It&rsquo;s just that their transition probabilities (Einstein A coefficients) are much smaller than permitted lines (with forbidden lines being less likely still).</p><ul><li>Semi-forbidden \(\mathrm{O\,III}],\lambda1666 \)Å</li><li>Forbidden \([\mathrm{O\,III}],\lambda5007 \)Å</li></ul><p>In terrestrial settings, it&rsquo;s more likely that an atom will be collisionally de-excited than emit in said transition. So it&rsquo;s more accurate to call these &ldquo;terrestrially-forbidden&rdquo; transitions.</p><h2 id=hyperfine-structure>Hyperfine Structure</h2><p>If the nucleus has a non-zero magnetic moment, the interaction of the magnetic fields of the nucleus and electrons gives rise to a small energy difference, which is called hyperfine structure. The hyperfine quantum number is
$$
\boldsymbol{F} = \boldsymbol{I} + \boldsymbol{J}
$$
where \(\boldsymbol{I}\) is the quantized spin angular momentum.</p><p>The most famous of these is the 21.106 cm line of neutral hydrogen (H I), i.e., the &ldquo;21-cm&rdquo; line, corresponding to the electron &ldquo;spin-flip.&rdquo;</p><p>But see also the hyperfine lines of HCN and \(\mathrm{C}_2 \mathrm{H}\) in protoplanetary disks.</p><h2 id=molecular-spectroscopy>Molecular Spectroscopy</h2><p><em>Molecular spectroscopy is hard</em>. But worthwhile. Why is molecular spectroscopy hard? Having two (or more) atoms destroys the nice symmetry that we had with atomic spectra. This means that there are <em>many more</em> ways for a molecule to move, which means many more degrees of freedom, which means many more quantum states to transition between and thus many more discrete photon energies to emit.</p><p>Most abundant, astrophysically-interesting molecules are diatomic molecules (having two atoms). Thankfully, this means we at least have a line of rotational symmetry along the <em>internuclear axis</em>, the line from one nucleus to another.</p><ul><li>homonuclear: having the same nucleus (e.g., \(H_2\), \(O_2\))</li><li>heteronuclear: having different nuclei (e.g., \(HD\), \(CO\) )</li></ul><p>The main types of molecular transitions that you will encounter in astrophysical contexts are either vibrational or rotational.</p><h2 id=vibrational-transitions>Vibrational Transitions</h2><p>Due to the quantization of the vibrational energy as atoms stretch on the internuclear axis.</p><figure><img src=/courses/astro542/lectures/04-energy-levels-atoms/rybicki-11-1.png alt="The potential between two atoms in a molecule as a function of their separation.

E_\mathrm{vib}(v) = \hbar \omega_0 (v + 1/2).

$$
\omega_0 = \sqrt{k/m_r}
$$
where in this case only, \(k\) is the spring constant for the harmonic oscillator. \(m_r\) is the reduced mass

m_r = \frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2}.

$$
E_\mathrm{rot}(J) = \frac{\hbar}{2I}J(J +1)
$$
where \(I\) is the molecule&rsquo;s moment of inertia. Typical rotational levels have energy differences approximately 100x smaller than vibrational levels, so each vibrational level is usually split into many rotational sub-levels.</p><p>Moment of inertia given by
$$
I = m_1 r_1^2 + m_2 r_2^2 = \mu R^2
$$</p><p>One would specify a transition using a combination of quantum numbers, like
$$

$$
a purely rotational transition.</p><h2 id=electronic-transitions>Electronic transitions</h2><p>Molecules can also have electronic transitions (i.e., w/ electrons), just like in atoms. And these typically have energies of a few eV and produce spectral lines in UV, optical and near-IR. Generally, though, when we&rsquo;re talking about observations of (diatomic) molecular spectra, we&rsquo;re usually dealing with rotational (radio) and sometimes vibrational (IR) transitions.</p></article></main></div></div></main><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script><script id=MathJax-script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js></script></body></html>
