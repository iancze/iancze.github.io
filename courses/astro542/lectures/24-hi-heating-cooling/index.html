Gas can be surveyed by 21-cm line (emission and absorption), absorption lines in spectra of stars, and infrared emission from dust mixed w/ hydrogen magnetic field in gas visualized through starlight polarized by aligned dust grains and in some cases Zeeman effect H I 21-cm line observations We covered a lot of this material when talking about excitation and atomic levels, but the following is a more observational picture."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.101.0"><title>HI Clouds: Observations, Heating and Cooling | Czekala Group</title><link rel=canonical href=/courses/astro542/lectures/24-hi-heating-cooling/><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-W5586VESJK"></script>

We will find that, under some circumstances, the ISM can be thought of as two distinct phases in pressure equilibrium.</p><h2 id=heating>Heating</h2><p>Heating mechanisms include</p><ul><li>ionization by CRs</li><li>Photoionization of H and He by x-rays</li><li>Photoionization of dust grains by starlight UV</li><li>Photoionization of metals like C, Mg, Si, Fe, etc. by starlight UV</li><li>Heating by shock waves and other MHD phenomena</li></ul><h3 id=photoelectric-heating-by-dust>Photoelectric heating by dust</h3><p>Photoelectrons emitted by dust grains dominate the heating of diffuse H I in the Milky Way.

As before, we require a balance between heating and cooling
$$
\Gamma(T_\mathrm{eq}) = \Lambda(T_\mathrm{eq}).
$$</p><p>First, let&rsquo;s examine how the steady state temperature \(T_\mathrm{eq}\) varies as a function of density \(n_H\).</p><figure><img src=fig_30_2a.jpg alt="The steady state temperature as a function of density, for gas heated by cosmic rays and photoelectric heating by dust grains.

Two lines of constant \(n_H T\) are shown. Credit: Draine Fig 30.2a</p></figcaption></figure><p>As we see, the equilibrium temperature is a monotonically decreasing function of \(n_H \). This is because of the line-cooling mechanisms, which are throttled by how quickly atoms can be collisionally excited (to be line-radiated away).</p><p>Now, let&rsquo;s examine the solution for equilibrium temperature when we fix the <em>pressure</em>
$$
p = n k T.
$$
Fixing the pressure is saying that things are in <em>dynamic equilibrium</em>, because if there was a pressure imbalance, then things would move to equalize pressure (the way wind blows from a high pressure system to a low pressure system on earth).</p><ul><li>We see that at <em>low pressures</em> the heating balances cooling at 6000 K (which correspond to WNM conditions).</li><li>We see that at <em>high pressure</em> the heating balances cooling at 100 K (corresponding to CNM conditions).</li></ul><p>When you combine a heating gain \(\Gamma\) that is independent of gas temperature with a cooling function \(\Lambda(T)\) that is not a simple power law, you get multiple phases of the ISM in pressure equilibrium with each other.</p><figure><img src=fig_30_2b.jpg alt="The steady state temperature as a function of thermal pressure \(p\). For pressures in the range between the two dotted lines, there are three possible equilibria temperatures: a high temperature WNM solution, a low temperature CNM solution, and an intermediate temperature equilibrium that is unstable.

The upper and lower solutions are stable (if perturbed away from equilibrium temperature, it will return to it). But the intermediate solution is unstable:</p><ul><li>if perturbed upward, it will warm to the stable WNM setup</li><li>if perturbed downward, it will cool to the stable CNM setup</li></ul><p>So, given our best estimates of cosmic ray ionization, photoelectric heating, and cooling processes in the diffuse ISM, we conclude that an ISM in thermal equilibrium and dynamic equilibrium (equal pressure) would have two distinct phases, provided the pressure is in between the two vertical lines (otherwise would just have one phase).</p><p>This is called the &ldquo;two-phase&rdquo; ISM model, and was first developed by George Field in 1969. Later revisited a number of times with differing assumptions about grain photoelectric heating, grain-assisted recombination, inelastic collisional cross-sections for cooling processes, and coolant abundances. So, the &ldquo;two-phase&rdquo; model has a long and storied history in ISM study. McKee and Ostriker 1977 expanded this to the &ldquo;three-phase&rdquo; ISM, with the hot ionized medium, where bremsstrahlung is the chief cooling process.</p><p>Observationally, the different phases will have different emission spectra.</p><p>First, the dust emission at 100 microns will be the same for both phases, since the dust is heated by the same radiation field. But, the line emission will vary considerably. For the CNM, the strongest coolant is [C II] 150 microns. For the WMN, the strongest coolant is [O I] 63.2 microns.</p></article></main></div></div></main><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script>
