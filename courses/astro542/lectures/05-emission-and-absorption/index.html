I like calling \(I_\nu\) the &ldquo;specific intensity,&rdquo; and that seems to be common usage in astronomy. In non-astronomy settings, this is called &ldquo;spectral intensity.&rdquo; If it is integrated over all frequency, it&rsquo;s sometimes called the radiant intensity \(I\).</p><p>\(I_\nu \) can be a little mind-bending to think about&mldr; it can be a function of</p><ul><li>3D space</li><li>direction</li><li>frequency</li></ul><p>Intensity itself is <em>not</em> a vector quantity but it is a scalar field that <em>is</em> function of direction. Draine and Rybicki and Lightman write the angular direction vector as \(\Omega\) and the solid angle surrounding that vector as \(\mathrm{d}\Omega\).</p><p>If we have a defined reference frame, we would probably write \(\Omega\) as a vector in spherical coordinates and define the components along \(\hat{\phi}\) and \(\hat{\theta}\) and let \(\mathrm{d}\Omega = d\phi \sin \theta d\theta\).</p><p>\(B_\nu\) is exactly the same type of variable, we just use it instead of \(I_\nu\) when we&rsquo;re referring to blackbody radiation, specifically of the form
$$
B_\nu = \frac{2 h \nu^3}{c^2}\frac{1}{e^{h \nu / kT} - 1}
$$
it also has units of
$$
\mathrm{ergs}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\;\mathrm{ster}^{-1}\;\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}
$$</p><h3 id=flux>Flux</h3><p>Once you&rsquo;ve defined \(I_\nu\), then it&rsquo;s relatively easy to calculate quantities like energy density, flux, momentum, etc, as integrals of the specific intensity field.</p><figure><img src=flux.png alt="How to calculate flux from specific intensity. Credit: Rybicki and Lightman Ch. 1"><figcaption><p>How to calculate flux from specific intensity. Credit: Rybicki and Lightman Ch. 1</p></figcaption></figure><p>$$
F_\nu = \int I_\nu \cos \theta d \Omega
$$
(intensity passing through some differential area \(dA\), lowered by the effective angle).</p><p>\(F_\nu\) has units of
$$
\mathrm{ergs}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\;\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}
$$
(i.e., angular dependence has been integrated out). I like using the unit of Jansky, which is
$$
1\,\mathrm{Jy} = 10^{-23} \mathrm{ergs}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\;\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}
$$</p><p>In astronomy settings, \(F_\nu\) is called the <em>spectral flux density</em>. In non-astronomy settings, this is called spectral irradiance. Sometimes you will see \(F_\lambda\), which has units
$$
\mathrm{ergs}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-1}
$$
(or per â„«, depending on your wavelength range).</p><p>Note that \(F_\nu\) and \(F_\lambda\) are flux <em>densities</em> or distribution function, which means that
$$
F_\nu \ne F_\lambda
$$
(their units are different)!</p><p>What is true is
$$
F_\nu \mathrm{d}\nu = F_\lambda \mathrm{d}\lambda
$$
because we&rsquo;re comparing two quantities with units
$$
\mathrm{ergs}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}
$$</p><p>You&rsquo;ll sometimes also see a spectral energy distribution plotted
$$
F_\nu \nu = F_\lambda \lambda
$$
this comes about because
$$
\nu = \frac{c}{\lambda}
$$
$$
\frac{d \lambda}{d \nu} = -\frac{c}{\nu^2} = -\frac{\lambda}{\nu}
$$
and the minus sign goes away because fluxes are defined per <em>positive</em> unit of frequency or wavelength.</p><p>I find the question of whether we&rsquo;re referring to</p><ul><li>\(I_\nu\): specific intensity (Jy/ster)</li><li>\(F_\nu\): spectral flux density (Jy)</li><li>\(F\): Bolometric flux \(\mathrm{ergs}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}\;\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\).</li></ul><p>to be endlessly confusing in conversation, because it&rsquo;s very common to colloquially use &ldquo;flux&rdquo; or &ldquo;brightness&rdquo; to mean a range of quantities, even though they have specific definitions in many settings. I find the clearest thing is to state the variable \(I_\nu\) or \(F_\nu\) (or \(F_\lambda\)) <em>and</em> the units.</p><h2 id=energy-density-and-photon-occupation-number>Energy density and photon occupation number</h2><p>The &ldquo;mean&rdquo; (directionally averaged) intensity is
$$
J_\nu = \frac{1}{4 \pi} \int I_\nu d \Omega = \frac{1}{4\pi} \int I_\nu \sin \theta d \theta d\phi.
$$
it has a different meaning than flux. In an isotropic radiation field, the net flux will be 0, whereas the mean intensity will have some positive value.</p><p>and the mean radiation density is
$$
u_\nu = \frac{4 \pi}{c} J_\nu.
$$
these quantities <em>are not</em> a function of direction, since we&rsquo;ve averaged over it.</p><p>For a thermal, blackbody spectrum, we have
$$
u_\nu = \frac{4 \pi}{c} B_\nu(T)
$$</p><p>In equilibrium, the absorbers must have levels populated according to
$$
\frac{n_u}{n_l} = \frac{g_u}{g_l}e^{(E_l - E_u)/kT}
$$</p><p><strong>The following doesn&rsquo;t depend on thermal equilibrium</strong></p><p>We can also write down the photon occupation number \(n_\gamma\), i.e., a dimensionless quantity tracking how many photons exist &ldquo;per given solid angle&rdquo;</p><p>$$
n_\gamma = \frac{c^2}{2 h \nu^3} I_\nu
$$</p><p>which we can average over all directions to get
$$
n_{\mathrm{bar},\gamma} = \frac{c^3}{8 \pi h \nu^3} u_\nu
$$
(a truly dimensionless quantity).</p><p>These photon occupation numbers make it easy to rewrite the transition rates.</p><p>From \( u \rightarrow l\)
$$
\left ( \frac{dn_l}{dt}\right)= n_u A_{ul} (1 + n_{\mathrm{bar},\gamma})
$$</p><p>Stimulated emission is not important when \( n_{\mathrm{bar},\gamma} \ll 1 \).</p><p>From \( l \rightarrow u\)
$$
\left ( \frac{d n_u}{dt} \right ) = n_l \frac{g_u}{g_l} A_{ul} n_{\mathrm{bar},\gamma}
$$</p><h2 id=absorption-cross-section>Absorption cross section</h2><p>Because we&rsquo;re talking about photons, instead of a velocity-dependent cross section, we will write a frequency-dependent cross section, \(\sigma(\nu)\). The velocity will be the speed of light \(c\).</p><p>Photon density [1/cm^3] per unit frequency
$$
\frac{u_\nu}{h \nu}
$$</p><p>Like in Ch 2, we would rate a rate as
$$
n_A n_B \langle \sigma v \rangle
$$
we&rsquo;ll do the same thing with \(n_l\), \(\frac{u_\nu}{h \nu}\), and \(\sigma(\nu)\).</p><p>For the \(l \rightarrow u\) transition,
$$
\left ( \frac{d n_u}{d t} \right ) = n_l \int d \nu \sigma_{lu}(\nu) c \frac{u_\nu}{h \nu}.
$$</p><p>We can relate this back to the Einstein B coefficient for absorption to find
$$
B_{lu} = \frac{c}{h \nu} \int d\nu \sigma_{lu}(\nu)
$$
relate this back to the \(A_{ul}\) coefficient,
$$
\int d_\nu \sigma_{lu}(\nu) = \frac{g_u}{g_l} \frac{c^2}{8 \pi \nu^2_{lu}} A_{ul}.
$$
Then solve for \(\sigma_{lu}(\nu)\)
$$
\sigma_{lu}(\nu) = \frac{g_u}{g_l} \frac{c^2}{8 \pi \nu^2_{lu}}A_{ul} \phi_\nu
$$
where \(\phi_\nu\) is a normalized line profile
$$
\int \phi_\nu d \nu = 1.
$$</p><h2 id=oscillator-strength>Oscillator strength</h2><p>You can also write these relationships with something called the oscillator strength, \(f_{lu}\).
$$
A_{ul} = \frac{8 \pi^2 e^2 \nu_{lu}^2}{m_e c^3} \frac{g_l}{g_u} f_{lu}
$$</p><h2 id=intrinsic-line-profile>Intrinsic line profile</h2><p>A Lorentzian is a good description of the intrinsic line profile (need quantum mechanical calculation to get it exact).</p><p>$$
\phi(\nu) = \frac{4 \gamma_{ul}}{16 \pi^2(\nu - \nu_{ul})^2 + \gamma_{ul}^2}
$$</p><p>The intrinsic width of the absorption line reflects the uncertainty in the energies of levels \(l,u\) due to the finite lifetimes against transitions to other levels.</p><p>Intrinsic widths of lines \(\propto h \nu\), which means x-ray transitions can have considerably larger line widths than radio transitions (assuming the medium is stationary).</p><p>We&rsquo;ll talk more about absorption line profiles, Doppler broadening, Voigt profiles, etc&mldr; in a few lectures.</p></article></main></div></div></main><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script>
