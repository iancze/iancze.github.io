$$
where \(H(a,u)\) is a dimensionless function describing the shape of the Voigt profile. It was first tabulated by Frode Hjerting in 1938, and is why we call this combined thing the Voigt-Hjerting function. You can use a special functions library to calculate this profile exactly; for our purposes, we are mainly concerned with observing the astrophysical behaviors that manifest from the fact that this profile has <em>both</em> a Gaussian core and Lorentzian wings. You can think of the \(a\) parameter (what R&P term the ratio of intrinsic broadening to thermal broadening) as a tuning between its &ldquo;Gaussian-ness&rdquo; (low \(a\)) and its &ldquo;Lorentzian-ness&rdquo; (high \(a\)).</p><figure><img src=fig_2_5.jpg alt="The Voight-Hjerting function \(H(a,u)\) with various intrinsic-to-broadening ratios \(a\).

$$
I_\nu(\tau_\nu) = I_\nu(0)e^{-\tau_\nu} + \int_0^{\tau_\nu} e^{-(\tau_\nu - \tau^\prime)}S_\nu d \tau^\prime
$$
Since
$$
S_\nu = \frac{j_\nu}{\kappa_\nu} \approx 0
$$
we have
$$
I_\nu(\tau_\nu) = I_\nu(0)e^{-\tau_\nu}
$$
For this problem, we basically have some initial (known) intensity that is attenuated by the intervening absorbers. The thing we want to calculate is the optical depth \(\tau_\nu\), which we do by
$$
\tau_\nu = \int \kappa_\nu d s = \int n_l \sigma_{lu}(\nu) ds
$$
$$
\tau_\nu = \frac{g_u}{g_l}\frac{c^2}{8 \pi \nu^2_{ul}}A_{ul} \int n_l \phi_\nu ds
$$
and from our assumptions we have \(\phi_\nu\) constant along line of sight so we can take
$$
\int n_l ds = N_l
$$
to a column density, and result in
$$
\tau_\nu = \frac{g_u}{g_l}\frac{c^2}{8 \pi \nu^2_{ul}}A_{ul} N_l \phi_\nu.
$$
Remember that \(\phi_\nu\) is our Voigt profile.</p><p>We can plug this back in and solve for the emergent intensity we were after
$$
I_\nu(\tau_\nu) = I_\nu(0)e^{-\tau_\nu}.
$$</p><ul><li><p>When \(\tau_\nu &lt; 1\), we can use the small exponent approximation to show that
$$
\frac{I_\nu(0) - I_\nu(\tau_\nu)}{I_\nu(0)} \approx \tau_\nu
$$
meaning that the absorption line profile \(I_\nu\) follows the optical depth \(\tau_\nu\) as a function of frequency.</p></li><li><p>When \(\tau_\nu \gg 1\), though, we get \(I_\nu(0)e^{-\tau_\nu} \approx 0\). Cold, dense, optically thick things (that are not emitting themselves) <em>block light</em>!</p></li></ul><figure><img src=fig_2_6.jpg alt="Lyman \(\alpha\) absorption lines with central optical depths of \(\tau\) from 1 through 1,000.

Figure 2.6 from Ryden and Pogge.</p></figcaption></figure><p>What&rsquo;s the relationship between \(I_\nu\) and \(F_\nu\) here? We&rsquo;re just considering a single small patch with differential solid angle \(\Delta \Omega\), assuming that the properties of the source are uniform over that area, so then the integral is over a constant area and we have
$$
I_\nu \propto F_\nu.
$$
So in this discussion about absorption lines and curve and growth, you may see \(F_\nu\) and \(I_\nu\) used interchangeably.</p><h2 id=equivalent-width>Equivalent width</h2><p>Equivalent width is a convenient and quick <em>but imperfect</em> way to boil down a rich measurement of \(I_\nu\) into a single number for tabulation.</p><figure><img src=equivalent_width.jpg alt="The equivalent width corresponding to the absorption line. Credit: Wikipedia/Szdori"><figcaption><p>The equivalent width corresponding to the absorption line. Credit: Wikipedia/Szdori</p></figcaption></figure><p>How to calculate equivalent width?</p><ul><li>Take high resolution spectrum of a source</li><li>Estimate the baseline &ldquo;continuum&rdquo; level from spectral regions that do not show absorption lines. Call this \(F_\nu(0)\)</li><li>Integrate over (sum up) the absorption line region \(F_\nu\)</li><li>Compare how much of the continuum region you&rsquo;d need (absorbed at 100%) to match the integrated absorption in the actual line</li></ul><p>The equivalent width is \(W\), and, confusingly, there are many different definitions out there in the wild.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re working at optical wavelengths, I always found the &ldquo;wavelength equivalent width&rdquo; to be the easiest to comprehend, which is calculated using \(F_\lambda\) common to optical spectra
$$
W_\lambda = \int \frac{\mathrm{continuum} - \mathrm{line}(\lambda)}{\mathrm{continuum}} d \lambda
$$
and has units of wavelength. Phrased with mathematical symbols
$$
W_\lambda = \int \frac{F_\lambda(0) - F_\lambda }{F_\lambda(0)} d \lambda.
$$</p><p><em>There are other definitions</em>! For example, R&P and Draine prefer a dimensionless equivalent width
$$
W = \int \frac{d \nu}{\nu_0} \left [ 1 - \frac{F_\nu}{F_\nu(0)} \right] = \int \frac{d \nu}{\nu_0} ( 1 - e^{-\tau_\nu}).
$$
We&rsquo;ll use the dimensionless equivalent width for any problem sets and tests (it has no units). They are related via
$$
W_\lambda \approx \lambda_0 W.
$$
The problem with the wavelength width is that if you measure \(W_\lambda = 1\)Å, it corresponds to a very different set of physical conditions if you&rsquo;re looking at a line with line center \(\lambda = 4000\)Å vs \(\lambda = 8000\)Å. This is because we would expect
$$
\frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda}
$$
to be approximately constant across the spectrum, and this is captured by the dimensionless equivalent width. There is also a velocity-equivalent width (\(W_v = c W\)). So, if you&rsquo;re going to compare equivalent widths, make sure you <em>understand the definition that is being used</em>. Some authors define \(W > 0\) for emission lines, others for absorption lines.</p><p>Much of the historical literature focuses on equivalent width measurements, and comparing these.</p><p><strong>My recommendation</strong>: If you are lucky to have a high resolution spectrum of an object, realize that <em>you have a lot of information</em> in how \(F_\nu\) varies with \(\nu\). Why go destroy some of it just to represent it as a single number? If you have a detailed physical model, you can fit \(F_\nu\) directly. Don&rsquo;t bother thinking too hard about equivalent widths.</p><p>For example, lets look at some real absorption lines and see why we&rsquo;d actually want to take a look at the spectra themselves rather than just reporting a single number, \(W\).<figure><img src=fig_2_2.jpg alt="UV interstellar absorption lines. Figure 2.2 Ryden and Pogge"><figcaption><p>UV interstellar absorption lines. Figure 2.2 Ryden and Pogge</p></figcaption></figure></p><p>That said, it&rsquo;s worthwhile thinking about how a line saturates with increasing optical depth, and the measure of equivalent width is useful for this exercise. Our goal is to</p><ul><li>Measure some line profile</li><li>Make some assessment of the optical depth</li><li>Use the line depth/shape and our understanding of radiative transfer to arrive at some conclusion about the column density of absorbers \(N_l\).</li></ul><h2 id=curve-of-growth>Curve of growth</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s examine how the line profile changes with increasing optical depth at line center, \(\tau_0\). <em>Note</em>: optical depth is not the same for all \(\lambda\), i.e., we have \(\tau_\lambda\) or \(\tau_\nu\)! That&rsquo;s the point of the whole upcoming discussion!</p><figure><img src=fig_2_6.jpg alt="Lyman \(\alpha\) absorption lines with central optical depths of \(\tau_0\) from 1 through 1,000.

This gives us confidence in assessing whether the transition is actually in the optically thin limit, and we can derive a more accurate result. E.g., you may see this for the Ca II K and Ca II H doublet transitions.</p><h2 id=lyman-alpha>Lyman \(\alpha\)</h2><p>In the ISM, atomic (neutral) hydrogen is almost always found in the ground state, and therefore the Lyman transitions are the most important. A <strong>resonance line</strong> is one that has permitted absorption out of the electronic ground state.</p><p>The Lyman \(\alpha\) transition \(1s \rightarrow 2p\) is very important because it allows us to directly measure the column density of atomic hydrogen.</p><p>Deuterium has a slightly frequency shifted Lyman series, which, in some cases, allows us to measure absorption lines for both hydrogen and deuterium, and therefore determine a D\H ratio for the interstellar/galactic gas.</p><h2 id=lyman-limit>Lyman limit</h2><p>Happens as \(n \rightarrow \infty\) and the wavelength differences between adjacent transitions from ground state smush together. You get a bit of a &ldquo;continuum&rdquo; opacity that has a cross-section that is very similar to that of the photoionization we covered in previous lectures. This is because a transition from ground state to very high \(n\) is very similar to that of an ionization cross section.</p><h2 id=metal-lines>Metal lines</h2><p>Many resonance lines for metals are in the ultraviolet, so you can only observe them from space, or using optical means for highly redshifted systems. Notable exceptions are Na I doublet, the K I doublet, and the Ca II doublet.</p><h2 id=gas-phase-abundances>Gas phase abundances</h2><p>Observed abundances vary from sightline to sightline, which is presumably evidence that elements end up trapped in dust grains. This removal of various elements is called <em>interstellar depletion</em>.</p><ul><li>Warm neutral medium: has high abundances</li><li>Cold neutral medium: has lower abundances</li><li>Warm ionized medium: very high abundances</li><li>Diffuse molecular clouds: very low abundances</li></ul></article></main></div></div></main><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script>
