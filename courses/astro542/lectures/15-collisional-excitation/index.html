Then,</p><p>The rate of change of the excited state is
$$
\frac{d n_1}{d t} = n_c n_0 k_{01} - n_c n_1 k_{10} - n_1 A_{10}.
$$
i.e., it&rsquo;s equal to how quickly level 1 is populated via collisions, minus how quickly level 1 is depopulated via collisions, minus how quickly level 1 is depopulated via spontaneous emission. Steady-state solution is \(dn_1/dt = 0\).</p><p>The law of mass action and the principle of detailed balance allow us to relate the collisional rate coefficients by
$$
\frac{k_{01}}{k_{10}} = \frac{g_1}{g_0} e^{-E_{10}/k T_\mathrm{gas}}.
$$
In the limit that \(n_c \rightarrow \infty\) (i.e., collisions thermalize the gas), the steady state solution has us bring about the relationship
$$
\frac{n_1}{n_0} = \frac{g_1}{g_0} e^{-E_{10}/k T_\mathrm{gas}}.

i.e., we&rsquo;re considering multi-level atoms and summing over all states \(l\) lower than the state under consideration (\(u\)).</p><p>For a two-level atom, this is
$$
n_\mathrm{crit} = \frac{(1 + n_\gamma) A_{ul}}{k_{ul}}
