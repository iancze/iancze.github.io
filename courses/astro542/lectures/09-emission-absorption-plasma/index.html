Here, we&rsquo;ll just write down the result
$$
j_{\mathrm{ff}, \nu} = \frac{8}{3} \left ( \frac{2 \pi}{3} \right)^{1/2} g_{\mathrm{ff}, i} \frac{e^6}{m_e^2 c^3} \left ( \frac{m_e}{kT} \right)^{1/2} e^{- h \nu / k T} n_e Z_i^2 n_i
$$
$$
j_{\mathrm{ff}, \nu} = 5.444 \times 10^{-41} g_\mathrm{ff} T_4^{-1/2} e^{- h \nu / k T} Z_i^2 n_i n_e \;\mathrm{erg}\;\mathrm{cm}^3\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}\;\mathrm{sr}^{-1}\;\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}
$$
here \(n_i\) represents the ions, and \(n_e\) represents the electrons.</p><p>\(g_{\mathrm{ff},i}(\nu, T)\) is the <strong>Gaunt factor for free-free transitions</strong>. When doing classical physics, Gaunt factor = 1. It&rsquo;s different from 1 when we need to treat quantum mechanical effects. Even then, the correction factor is only 1 order of magnitude different from 1, across a wide range of frequencies.</p><p>If we assume that \(g_{\mathrm{ff},i}(\nu, T)\) is constant (w \(\nu\)), then the emissivity is flat (independent) with frequency at low frequencies.</p><p>We can calculate the power radiated per volume as
$$
\Lambda_\mathrm{ff} = 4 \pi \int_0^\infty j_{\mathrm{ff},\nu} d \nu
$$
and we get that
$$
\Lambda_\mathrm{ff} \propto n_i n_e \sqrt{T}
$$</p><p>See Draine 10.2 and 10.3 for how to properly calculate and average over the Gaunt factor for various regimes.</p><h2 id=free-free-absorption>Free-free absorption</h2><p>If we have a thermal distribution, then Kirchoff&rsquo;s law must be satisfied
$$
B_\nu = \frac{j_\nu}{\kappa_\nu}
$$
where \(B_\nu\) is the Planck function. Kirchoff&rsquo;s law is a neat trick, because we can go calculate the attenuation coefficient \(\kappa_\nu\) from the emissivity \(j_\nu\).</p><p>$$
\kappa_{\mathrm{ff},\nu} = \frac{4}{3} \left ( \frac{2 \pi}{3} \right)^{1/2} \frac{e^6}{m_e{3/2} (k T)^{1/2} h c \nu^3} \left [ 1 - e^{- h \nu / k T} \right] Z_i^2 n_i n_e g_\mathrm{ff}
$$</p><p>from the frequency dependence, we see that free-free absorption becomes strong at low (radio) frequencies.</p><h2 id=emission-measure>Emission Measure</h2><p>Calculate the intensity \(I_\nu\) from free-free emission from an ionized region
$$
I_\nu(s) = I_\nu(0) e^{-\tau_\nu} + \int_0^s d s^\prime j_{\mathrm{ff},\nu} e^{-[\tau_\nu(s) - \tau_nu(s^\prime)]}
$$
$$
I_\nu(s) = I_\nu(0) e^{-\tau_\nu} + \int_0^{\tau_\nu} d \tau^\prime \left [ \frac{j_{\mathrm{ff}, \nu}}{\kappa_{\mathrm{ff}, \nu}} \right] e^{-(\tau - \tau^\prime)}
$$
If the region has a uniform temperature, then the integral becomes
$$
I_\nu = I_\nu(0) e^{-\tau_\nu} + \left [ \frac{j_{\mathrm{ff}, \nu}}{\kappa_{\mathrm{ff}, \nu}} \right]<em>T (1 - e^{-\tau</em>\nu})
$$</p><p>Now let&rsquo;s define something called the <em>emission measure</em>
$$
EM = \int n_e n_p ds = \left [ \frac{n_e n_p}{\kappa_{\mathrm{ff},\nu}} \right ]<em>T \tau</em>\nu.
$$
Since most clouds are net neutral, we can write
$$
EM \approx \int n_e^2 ds.
$$</p><p>We can rewrite the RTE,
$$
I_\nu = I_\nu(0) e^{-\tau_\nu} + \frac{(1 - e^{-\tau_\nu})}{\tau_\nu} \left [ \frac{j_{\mathrm{ff},\nu}}{n_e n_p} \right ]<em>T EM
$$
when we are very optically thin (\(\tau \ll 1 \)), we have
$$
\frac{(1 - e^{-\tau</em>\nu})}{\tau_\nu} \approx 1.
$$
We can plug back in for the Brehmsstralung emissivity and obtain the result that intensity <em>increases linearly with EM</em>. See Draine Ch 10.5 for prefactors.</p><p>For low frequencies \(\nu \leq 1 \) GHz, self-absorption can become important in dense H II regions. Generally negligible in other ISM settings.</p><h2 id=free-bound-transitions-recombination-continuum>Free-bound transitions: Recombination continuum</h2><p>Electron captured by an ion, making the transition from a &ldquo;free&rdquo; state to a &ldquo;bound&rdquo; state, and emitting a photon.</p><p>How might we calculate the emissivity \(j_{\mathrm{fb},\nu}\) for this interaction, assuming LTE (i.e., thermal plasma)?</p><p>Let&rsquo;s think about the tools that we need: \(\kappa_\nu\), \(B_\nu\), \(\sigma\), \(n_b\)</p><p>Here&rsquo;s one way to go about it. In our second lecture on collisional processes, we used the impact approximation to approximately calculate the cross section for photoionization, \(\sigma_b\). We assumed there was an electron with some kinetic energy, it engaged in some momentum transfer with the atom, and this extra change in momentum unbound it&rsquo;s own electron, ionizing the atom.</p><p>Then, we know that we can use our result from the radiative process lecture for net absorption
$$
\kappa_\nu = n_l \sigma_{l \rightarrow u}(\nu) - n_u \sigma_{u \rightarrow l}(\nu)
$$
to write
$$
\kappa_\nu = n_l \sigma_b(\nu) \left [ 1 - e^{-h \nu/k T_\mathrm{exc}} \right].
$$</p><p>Next, let&rsquo;s reuse Kirchoff&rsquo;s law to relate
$$
j_{\mathrm{fb}, \nu} = \kappa_{\mathrm{bf}, \nu} B_\nu(T)
$$
and, since we are in LTE, \(T_\mathrm{exc} = T\), so
$$
j_{\mathrm{fb}, \nu} = n_b \sigma_b(\nu) \left [ 1 - e^{-h \nu/k T} \right ] B_\nu(T)
$$
where \(n_b\) is the number density of atoms in bound state b, if in LTE with electron density \(n_e\), and ion density \(n_i\). For example, \(n_b\) could be the number of hydrogen atoms with principle quantum number \(n=3\).</p><p>Finally, we would like to rewrite \(n_b\) in terms of the overall number densities of electrons and ions and the temperature of the plasma, because in a moment we&rsquo;re going to want to consider multiple different bound states. To do this, we need to refer back to the statistical mechanics lecture and the <em>law of mass action</em>. One result from that lecture was the ability to take the reaction for photoionization
$$
H(n) + e^- \leftrightarrow H^+ + 2e^-
$$
and write down the relative number densities, obtaining</p><p>$$
\left [ \frac{n(H(n))}{n(H^+) n_e} \right]_\mathrm{LTE} = \left [ \frac{h^3}{(2 \pi k T)^{3/2}} \right] \left [ \frac{m_H}{m_p m_e} \right]^{3/2} \frac{g[H(n)]}{g(e^-) g(H^+)} e^{-I_n/kT}
$$</p><p>where</p><p>$$
I_n = \frac{I_H}{n^2}
$$</p><p>is the energy required to ionize \(H(n)\). Finally, putting it all together, we have</p><p>$$
j_{\mathrm{fb},\nu} = \frac{g_b}{2 g_i} \frac{h^4 \nu^3}{(2 \pi m_e k T)^{3/2} c^2} e^{(I_b - h \nu)/k T} \sigma_b(\nu) n_e n_i
$$
where \(g_b\) is the degeneracy of the bound state, \(g_i\) is the degeneracy of the ion, and \(I_b\) is the energy required to ionize from bound state.</p><p>So, what did we do? We started with a photoionization cross section, related that to an absorption coefficient, used Kirchoff&rsquo;s law and LTE assumptions to relate <em>that</em> to an emissivity, and then rewrote the number densities of the bound state \(n_b\) in terms of more-easily calculable quantities, \(n_e\) and \(n_i\).</p><p>Some take aways:</p><ul><li>Generally, the free-bound emissivity is proportional to
$$
j_{\mathrm{fb},\nu} \propto n_e n_i.
$$</li><li>Each bound state contributes its own bit of recombination continuum starting at \(h \nu = I_b\), which is the minimum energy photon that can be emitted when an electron transitions from free to bound state b</li><li>The recombination continuum tapers off at higher frequncies by the factor \(e^{(I_b - h \nu)/k T} \)</li></ul><p>Now let&rsquo;s examine this emission spectrum for a hydrogen plasma</p><figure><img src=fig_10_2.jpg alt="Solid line is the continuous emission spectrum of a \(T=8000)) K hydrogen plasma, including free-free emission, recombination continuum emission, and two-photon emission.
