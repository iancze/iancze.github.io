Ionized nebulae are far from blackbodies (not a terrible approximation for opaque bodies like stars). I.e., a blackbody absorbs all incident radiation and emits blackbody radiation.
A parcel of gas (say, containing neutral hydrogen atoms) can be in LTE (thermalized via collisions w/ free electrons) but not be a blackbody (i."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.119.0"><title>Nebular Diagnostics | Czekala Group</title><link rel=canonical href=/courses/astro542/lectures/16-nebular-diagnostics/><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-W5586VESJK"></script>

A transition from this state to the \(J=1,2\) states of the ground state are forbidden magnetic dipole transitions, and the transition to the \(J=0\) is an even more strongly forbidden electric quadrupole transition.</p><p>Each of these transitions produce lines like [O III], [N II] that are in the optical band, and thus easily observable from the ground. These lines include those frequently termed &ldquo;nebular lines&rdquo; \({}^1 \mathrm{D} \rightarrow {}^3 \mathrm{P}_J \) (because they were first seen in planetary nebulae)</p><p>and &ldquo;auroral lines&rdquo; \({}^1 \mathrm{S} \rightarrow {}^1 \mathrm{D} \) because a similar line is seen in Earth&rsquo;s aurorae. We number the different energy levels with numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 for simplicity, so we don&rsquo;t need to keep using the spectroscopic notation. There are higher energy levels to the ions, but at typical temperatures in ISM they are essentially unpopulated.</p><p>Now let&rsquo;s calculate temperature from observed line strength. First, assume we are in the low-density limit such that</p><ul><li>\(n_e &lt; n_\mathrm{crit} \) for each line under consideration</li><li>meaning collisional excitation is followed by radiative de-excitation (not collisional de-excitation)</li><li>radiative de-excitation will primarily be spontaneous instead of stimulated emission</li></ul><p>The emissivity from spontaneous emission is
$$
j_\nu = n_u \frac{A_{ul}}{4 \pi} h \nu_{ul} \Phi_\nu
$$
so, integrated over the line profile, we have
$$
j(4 \rightarrow 3) = n_4 \frac{A_{43}}{4 \pi} h \nu_{43}.
$$</p><p>When we are in excitational equilibrium, the rate of collisional excitation from the ground state (remember, most things in ground state) to level 4 will be balanced by the radiative de-excitation from level 4.</p><p>For quantum mechanical reasons, transitions from 4 to 2 and 4 to 0 are strongly forbidden. Therefore we only need to take into account the transitions from 4 to 3 and 4 to 1
$$
n_0 n_e k_{04} = n_4 (A_{43} + A_{41}).
$$
We can use this with the previous equation to include the collinional rate coefficient (and thus the temperature dependence) in the emissivity as
$$
j(4 \rightarrow 3) = \frac{n_0 n_e}{4 \pi} k_{04} \frac{A_{43}}{A_{43} + A_{41}} h \nu_{43}
$$
the temperature dependence comes in through the \(k_{04}\) term.</p><p>Now let&rsquo;s consider the \(3\rightarrow 2\) line. Like the level 4 state, the level 3 state can be populated through direct collisional excitation, but it can also be populated through radiative de-excitation from the level 4 state. So, we would write</p><p>$$
j(3 \rightarrow 2) = \frac{n_0 n_e}{4 \pi} \left [ k_{03} + k_{04} \frac{A_{43}}{A_{43} + A_{41}}\right] \frac{A_{32}}{A_{32} + A_{31}} h \nu_{32}.
$$</p><p>We can get rid of the dependence on density by taking the ratio of the line strengths
$$
\frac{j(4 \rightarrow 3)}{j(3 \rightarrow 2)} = \frac{A_{43} \nu_{43}}{A_{32} \nu_{32}} \frac{(A_{32} + A_{31}) k_{04}}{(A_{43} + A_{41})k_{03} + A_{43} k_{04}}.
$$
All of the \(A\) terms are known from quantum mechanics, and the collisional rate coefficients are dependent on temperature.</p><p>From the principle of detailed balance, we can relate the collisional rate coefficients by
$$
\frac{k_{0u}}{k_{u0}} = \frac{g_u}{g_0} \exp \left (- \frac{h \nu_{u0}}{k T} \right).
$$</p><p>In practice, there are some simplifications and factorizations that occur. First, we write the collision de-excitation rate cofficient as
$$
k_{u0} = \frac{\beta}{T^{1/2}} \frac{\Omega_{u0}}{g_u}
$$
where
$$
\beta = \left ( \frac{2 \pi \hbar^4}{k m_e^3} \right)^{1/2}
$$
and \(\Omega_{u0}\) is a dimensionless collision strength. \(\Omega_{u0}\) is nearly independent of temperature (and of order unity) so \(k_{u0} \propto T^{-1/2}\).</p><p>We can refactor the line strength ratios into
$$
\frac{j(4 \rightarrow 3)}{j(3 \rightarrow 2)} = \frac{A_{43} \nu_{43}}{A_{32} \nu_{32}} \frac{(A_{32} + A_{31}) \Omega_{40} \exp(- h \nu_{43}/kT)}{(A_{43} + A_{41} \Omega_{30})+ A_{43} \Omega_{40} \exp(- h \nu_{43} / kT)}.
$$
The temperature dependence is now isolated to the exponent. We&rsquo;re going to get the most variation in the line ratios for temperatures \(kT \approx h \nu_{43}\), which is 1.96 eV for S III and 2.84 eV for O III.</p><h2 id=calculating-density>Calculating density</h2><p>To calculate density, its helpful to identify an ion with two electronic transitions that are similar in energy but have very different critical densities. One good example is singly ionized oxygen, O II.</p><p>Remember that critical density
$$
n_\mathrm{crit} = \frac{(1 + n_\gamma) A_{ul}}{k_{ul}}.
$$</p><p>The first excited state \({}^2 \mathrm{D}^O\) is split into a pair of fine structure sub-levels, whose energies are finely separated. Thus, the transitions from the first excited state to ground produce a line doublet (two lines closely spaced in wavelength). The critical densities for the different lines of the doublet, however, are substantially different.</p><figure><img src=fig4-7.jpg alt="Energy levels of the O II and S II ions. Credit: Ryden and Pogge Figure 4.7"><figcaption><p>Energy levels of the O II and S II ions. Credit: Ryden and Pogge Figure 4.7</p></figcaption></figure><p>Following a similar path as before, we&rsquo;ll write down the emissivities for each line of the doublet and then compute their ratios, and do some simplifications using collisional strengths to get</p><p>$$
\frac{j(2\rightarrow 0)}{j(1 \rightarrow 0)} \approx \frac{\Omega_{02}}{\Omega_{01}} \frac{1 + n_e/n_{\mathrm{crit},1}}{1 + n_e/n_{\mathrm{crit},2}}.
$$</p><p>In the low-density limit, we have
$$
\frac{j(2\rightarrow 0)}{j(1 \rightarrow 0)} \approx \frac{\Omega_{02}}{\Omega_{01}},
$$
the line ratios are independent of the free electron density \(n_e\).</p><p>In the high density limit, we have
$$
\frac{j(2\rightarrow 0)}{j(1 \rightarrow 0)} \approx \frac{\Omega_{02}}{\Omega_{01}}\frac{n_{\mathrm{crit},2}}{n_{\mathrm{crit},1}},
$$
which is again independent of the free electron density \(n_e\) (but does depend on the critical densities of each transition).</p><p>To get something that does depend on the free electron density, we need to be in the regime where \(n_e\) is larger than one critical density but smaller than the other. For the O II transition we&rsquo;ve been talking about, you can get line ratios that range from 0.4 to 1.4, which is a decent dynamic range.</p><p>And, of course, in a modern analysis, usually multiple temperature and density diagnostics are combined into a single estimate of temperature and density.</p><p>More details are in Ryden and Pogge, Ch 4.4.</p></article></main></div></div></main><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script>
