In general, individual clouds are separated into categories based upon their optical appearance: diffuse, translucent, or dark, depending on the magnitudes of visual extinction \(A_V\) through the cloud.
Diffuse molecular cloud: \(A_V < 1 \) mag Translucent molecular cloud: \(1 < A_V < 5 \) mag Dark cloud: \(5 < A_V < 20 \) mag Infrared Dark cloud: 20 up to \(> 100 \) mag Diffuse and translucent clouds have sufficient UV radiation to keep gas-phase carbon photoionized throughout the cloud."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.101.0"><title>Molecular Clouds, Observations, Chemistry, and Ionization | Czekala Group</title><link rel=canonical href=/courses/astro542/lectures/26-molecular-clouds/><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-W5586VESJK"></script>

First, Herschel noticed in 1785 that there were patches along the Milky Way where very few stars were seen, but he incorrectly attributed this to an actual underdensity.</p><p>Now, we know that this is from the obscuration by dusty clouds.</p><p>Modern studies including J, H, K to optical surveys can now provide a very good map of dusty. In fact, coupling stellar measurements with spectral models, and in some cases distances, allows us to make a 3D map of the dust distribution in our Galaxy.</p><h2 id=molecular-radio-lines>Molecular radio lines</h2><p>Most common way to study molecular gas is through the \(J = 1 \rightarrow 0\) transition of carbon monoxide.

Outflows from protostars could be one possibility.</p><p>Another is that the time scale for shock waves to damp is longer than expected (but not backed up by simulations).</p><h1 id=molecular-clouds-chemistry-and-ionization>Molecular Clouds: Chemistry and Ionization</h1><p>In the Milky Way, about 22% of interstellar gas is in molecular clouds, and most of the hydrogen there is in the form of \(H_2\).</p><p>Cosmic Rays guarantee that there are always <em>some</em> ions present in the gas, and in the outer layers of molecular clouds there may be enough UV radiation to photoionize metal species.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s walk through the various types of reactions that can be important</p><ol><li><strong>photoionization</strong>:
$$
AB + h \nu \rightarrow AB^+ + e^-
$$
Many molecules can be photoionized w/ photons with \(h \nu &lt; 13.6\) eV (but not \(H_2\), which has an ionization potential of 15.43). Thus, molecular hydrogen will not be photoionized even in H I regions.</li><li><strong>photodissociation</strong>:
$$
AB + h \nu \rightarrow AB^* \rightarrow A + B
$$
For species like \(H_2\) and CO, photoexcitation leading to dissociation occurs via <em>lines</em> rather than continuum. This key fact allows these species to self-shield, or be partially shielded (like CO) if there is accidental overlap between important absorption lines with strong lines of \(H_2\).</li><li>Neutral-neutral exchange reactions
$$
AB + C \rightarrow AC + B
$$
In a molecular cloud, most species are neutral, and so neutral-neutral collisions are frequent. Frequently, there will be an energy barrier that must be overcome for a reaction to proceed, i.e., the ABC complex must pass through an intermediate stat that has higher energy level than the initial AB + C, even for exothermic reactions. Interestingly, this isn&rsquo;t the case for CO formation, which has a negligible energy barrier and can form at the low temperatures of molecular clouds
$$
C + OH \rightarrow CO + H
$$</li><li>Ion-neutral exchange reactions
$$
AB^+ + C \rightarrow AC^+ + B
$$
Exothermic reactions of this type generally lack energy barriers, so the reaction can proceed even at low temperatures. And, the induced dipole interaction boosts the rate somewhat.</li><li>Radiative association reactions (as we discussed in the context of molecular hydrogen). Basically, the excited complex needs to emit a photon before the complex flies apart on the timescale of a single vibrational period.</li></ol></article></main></div></div></main><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script>
