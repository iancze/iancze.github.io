At optical wavelengths, most photons are starlight. Local starlight background is the sum of diffuse blackbodies. Within an H I region, very little radiation at UV and FUV wavelengths (see super shop dropoff), because this radiation is strongly absorbed by neutral H and He. This type of radiation is very important for photoexciting \(\mathrm{H}_2\) and other molecules, photoionizing heavy elements, and ejecting photons from dust grains. The UV radiation is very spatially variable, because the O and B stars that are the primary emitters of this radiation are sporadic and clumped together in star forming regions.</li></ul><figure><img src=plate1.png alt="Credit: Draine Plate 1"><figcaption><p>Credit: Draine Plate 1</p></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>X-ray emission</strong> from very hot (\(T = 10^5 - 10^8\)) K plasma.

Lower energies easily absorbed by neutral H I, so at the boundary between this and the starlight regions, the radiation density is highly variable. In external galaxies, AGN can make this part of energy density much higher.</li></ul><figure><img src=plate5.png alt="Credit: Draine Plate 5"><figcaption><p>Credit: Draine Plate 5</p></figcaption></figure><h3 id=spectrum-in-a-photodissociation-region-pdr>Spectrum in a photodissociation region (PDR)</h3><p>Let&rsquo;s look at a massive O star illuminating an H II region adjacent to a molecular cloud, called a photodissociation region or PDR.</p><p>Compared to the previous, this radiation field additionally includes</p><ul><li>radiation from the O star (at \( h \nu &lt; 13.6 )) eV), everything higher absorbed within H II</li><li>free-free emission from H II region</li><li>line emission from H II</li><li>emission from warm dust in PDR</li></ul><figure><img src=fig_12_3.jpg alt="Radiation field in neutral gas adjacent to an H II: region.

If recombination takes place such that the electron goes straight to the ground state, then the photon that is emitted can ionize hydrogen. If the region has a significant population of neutral hydrogen, then the emitted photon will have a high probability of being absorbed close to where it was emitted. This sets up two &ldquo;regimes&rdquo; of recombination,<ul><li><strong>Case A</strong>: the region is <em>optically thin</em> to ionizing radiation, such that every ionizing photon emitted during the process escapes. Happens in collisionally ionized regions that are very hot (and very low density)</li><li><strong>Case B</strong>: the region is <em>optically thick</em> to ionizing radiation, such that ionizing photons emitted are immediately absorbed. The recombinations directly to the ground state do not change the ionization of the gas, only recombinations to states \(n \geq 2\) do. Happens in photoionized nebulae around O and B stars, aka H II regions</li></ul></li></ul><p>The hydrogen recombination emission spectrum can be calculated from the radiative decays from one level to one or more lower levels.
