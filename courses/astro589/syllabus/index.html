However, each student must complete the final write up on their own, i.e., no problem set should be duplicated verbatim between students.</p><h3 id=group-project-and-presentation>Group project and presentation</h3><p>Students will form groups of 2-3 for their course projects. Groups will propose a project concept around some aspect of interferometry and discuss in detail at least one major astrophysical application. The project idea may be based of the list of example projects (below) or may be an original idea proposed by the group.</p><p>The project will culminate in a presentation to the class. This presentation will be a comprehensive lecture on your topic, which should take 35 minutes of our class period, followed by 15 minutes of detailed questions and answers. Students may submit any additional materials beyond their presentation for review, if so desired; however, no final report is required.</p><p>Good presentations will:</p><ul><li>Provide a cogent astrophysical and technical introduction</li><li>Connect to course material covered (if applicable)</li><li>Introduce the key supporting background material, including any relevant equations or seminal figures from related works</li><li>Copious citations to and explanations of relevant literature</li><li>Explain the key observational or theoretical instruments/methodologies (as applicable)</li><li>Identify at least one major astrophysical application and discuss in detail</li><li>Contain some new aspect of technical development or investigation by the group</li><li>Finish the presentation within the allotted time (35 +/- 5 minutes)</li><li>Adequately answer questions raised by the instructor and students</li></ul><p>Each group should provide the instructor with their proposed group by <strong>Wednesday, September 21st</strong>. The instructor will then assign one presentation date to each group. You should notify the instructor of your project topic at least two weeks prior to your presentation date to confirm that it is an acceptable choice.</p><p>It is a wise idea to practice your presentation from start to finish &ldquo;live&rdquo; to make sure your timing is correct. Groups whose talks are wildly under/over time will find it difficult to achieve full credit.</p><h4 id=example-project-ideas>Example Project Ideas</h4><ul><li>Cross-validation strategies for imaging (including for RML)</li><li>How do MRI imagers work, and what are their fundamental relationships to radio interferometers?</li><li>Optical interferometers and science results</li><li>Download a dataset from the ALMA archive, image with CLEAN or RML techniques</li><li>Calibration techniques for ALMA and EHT</li><li>Self-calibration theory and application with CASA</li><li>Spectral line capabilities of ALMA, image a molecular line from ALMA archive</li><li>Wavelets: what are they, how have they been used in radio astronomy applications</li><li>Design new ALMA observations using CASA/simobserve</li><li>Expanding MPoL to do <a href=https://github.com/MPoL-dev/MPoL/issues/33>model fitting with Pyro</a></li><li>Expanding MPoL for <a href=https://github.com/MPoL-dev/MPoL/issues/77>fake data generation</a></li><li>Expanding MPoL to use <a href=https://github.com/MPoL-dev/MPoL/issues/17>nufft for gridding</a></li><li>Expanding MPoL to do <a href=https://github.com/MPoL-dev/MPoL/issues/24>self-calibration</a></li><li>Expanding MPoL to do <a href=https://github.com/MPoL-dev/MPoL/issues/23>primary beam corrections</a></li><li>Wide-field imaging: what changes about the imaging assumptions, applications</li><li>Briggs weighting: (introduction, Briggs&rsquo;s thesis, application w/ CASA)</li><li>Time and bandwidth smearing: theory, demonstrations with CASA and real ALMA data</li><li>Non-parametric techniques for protoplanetary surface brightness profiles, including <a href=https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020MNRAS.495.3209J/abstract>frank</a></li><li>Beam-forming and applications</li></ul><h4 id=a-note-about-scope>A note about scope</h4><p>Radio astronomy is a vast and deep topic&mdash;some of these project topics are considerable in scope and could constitute Ph.D. theses (some have). The primary purpose of the group project is to <em>educate yourself and your classmates on an advanced radio astronomy and/or imaging topic</em>. To that end, I encourage you to focus most of your time on developing a solid understanding of the concept and designing a pedagogical presentation that clearly develops and introduces core practical and theoretical components.</p><p>For example, if you were to choose to cover time and bandwidth smearing, I would expect at least half and potentially 2/3 of your presentation to be pedagogical, i.e., extending the mathematical formalism we discussed in class to arrive at why time and bandwidth smearing occur in an interferometric system, highlighting and presenting classical treatments on the topic from our class textbooks, and presenting an astrophysical observation (i.e., published journal article) that discussed their approach to mitigating these effects. You may also choose to cover historical development of the topic, if relevant.</p><p>The &ldquo;technical&rdquo; component of the presentation is designed to be an opportunity for you to practically apply your knowledge, either by application to a real dataset or development of a new algorithm (e.g., for MPoL). It is meant as a <em>supplement</em> to the aforementioned pedagogical treatment, not a substitute for it. Keeping with the time/bandwidth smearing example, an appropriate technical component to the project would be to download a dataset from the ALMA archive and use CASA to synthesize a range of images after various amounts of time and/or bandwidth averaging have been applied, and discuss if/how time or bandwidth smearing has compromised the image quality.</p><p>Presentations that do not devote proper coverage to introductory/pedagogical material will find it difficult to achieve a satisfactory grade&mdash;even those that have an impressive technical application. Conversely, group projects that fail to write a single line of new code but deliver a quality pedagogical component would likely still receive a passing grade.</p><p>I strongly encourage all groups to keep in contact with me as you are developing your project ideas, so that I may provide feedback on scope.</p><h2 id=reference-materials>Reference Materials</h2><p>There are many additional resources that will be helpful during this course (and beyond) and will be called out in the course at the appropriate juncture.
