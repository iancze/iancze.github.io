z = r e^{i \varphi} = r (\cos \varphi + i \sin \varphi).
$$</p><p>This is closely related to Euler&rsquo;s formula
$$
e^{i x} = \cos x + i \sin x
$$
for a complex sinusoid. It&rsquo;s useful to keep in mind Euler&rsquo;s identity:
$$
e^{i \pi} + 1 = 0.
$$</p><p>It&rsquo;s possible to convert from the Cartesian form to polar form and vice-versa:
$$
r = |z| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}
$$
and
$$
\varphi = \arg(z) = \arg(a + bi)
$$
which is most easily carried out using the <code>arctan2</code> function, to avoid quadrant ambiguities.
$$
\varphi = \mathrm{arctan2}(b, a).
$$</p><p>You can go from polar back to Cartesian by writing
$$
z = r e^{i \varphi} = r (\cos \varphi + i \sin \varphi)
$$
and then doing
$$
a = \Re(z) = r \cos \varphi
$$
and
$$
b = \Im(z) = r \sin \varphi.

Bracewell</li><li>Appendix 2.1 of <a href=https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/20789467>Interferometry and Synthesis in Radio Astronomy</a> by Thompson, Moran, and Swenson</li></ul><p>First, we&rsquo;ll introduce the equations and then explain what&rsquo;s going on.</p><p><strong>Forward transform</strong>:
$$
F(s) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-i 2 \pi x s}\,\mathrm{d}x
$$
also called the &ldquo;minus-\(i\)&rdquo; transform.</p><p><strong>Inverse transform</strong>:
$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(s) e^{i 2 \pi x s}\,\mathrm{d}s
$$
also called the &ldquo;plus-\(i\)&rdquo; transform.</p><p>Note that there are alternate conventions for the Fourier transform pairs, which vary as to whether the \(2 \pi\) factor appears in the exponent or as a pre-factor. We prefer the notation we&rsquo;ve provided here because we find it much easier to keep track of \(2\pi\) factors.</p><p><strong>Successive transforms</strong>:</p><p>We can show that
$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left [ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-i 2 \pi x s}\,\mathrm{d}x \right ] e^{i 2 \pi x s}\,\mathrm{d}s,
$$
i.e., successive transformations yield back the original function. We don&rsquo;t have time to walk through the proof, but it&rsquo;s available in <a href=https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/20789467>TMS Section A2.1</a>.</p><p>Therefore, we have
$$
f(x) \leftrightharpoons F(s),
$$
where the \(\leftrightharpoons\) denotes a Fourier transform pair. Sometimes you might also see the notation \(\leftrightarrow\). Generally, if we have functions like \(f\) or \(g\), then we denote their Fourier transform pairs with captial letters (e.g., \(F\), \(G\))).</p><p><strong>How to think about the domains</strong>
The Fourier transform maps domains from \(x\) to \(s\), where \(s\) has units of &ldquo;cycles per unit of \(x\)&rdquo;. E.g., if \(x\) is in units of time (seconds), then \(s\) has units of cycles/second, commonly known as hertz. The FT can also be applied to spatial distance coordinates (e.g., \(x\) in meters) and spatial coordinates on the sky (e.g., \(x\) in arcseconds).</p><p>So let&rsquo;s say someone is playing a chord on a musical instrument. If \(f(x)\) represents the time-series of pressure values near your ear, then \(F(s)\) represents the notes that are being played (we would probably be most interested in something like \(|F(s)|^2\) for power as a function of frequency, like a spectrogram).</p><p><a href=https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/spectrogram/>Musical Spectrogram link</a></p><h3 id=conditions-on-existence>Conditions on existence</h3><p>Given the strong evidence via physical systems that the Fourier transform of particular time-series exists (e.g., spectrums for waveforms, antenna radiation patterns), there are actually some mathematical functions whose Fourier transforms do not exist.</p><p>Physical possibility (in physical systems) is a sufficient condition for the existence of its transform.</p><p>Sometimes, though, we consider waveforms like</p><ul><li>\(\sin(t)\): harmonic wave</li><li>\(H(t)\): Heaviside step</li><li>\(\delta(t)\): impulse</li></ul><p>Strictly speaking, none of these functions has a Fourier transform. What do we mean that they do not have Fourier transforms?
$$
F(s) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-i 2 \pi x s}\,\mathrm{d}x
$$
does not converge for all values of \(s\). Consider \(\sin(t)\) integrated from \((-\infty, \infty)\)&mldr; it&rsquo;ll just keep oscillating about 0.</p><p>None of these waveforms are actually physically possible, though, because a waveform \(\sin(t)\) would have need to been switched on an infinite time ago, a step function would need to be maintained for an infinite time, and an impulse would need to be infinitely large for an infinitely short time.</p><p>So, what are the conditions for the existence of Fourier transforms.</p><ol><li>The integral of \(|f(x)|\) from \(-\infty\) to \(\infty\) exists.</li><li>Any discontinuities in \(f(x)\) are finite.</li></ol><p>In a physical circumstance, these conditions would be violated when there is infinite energy.</p><h3 id=transforms-in-the-limit>Transforms in the limit</h3><p>Though we just outlined functional forms whose Fourier transforms do not <em>strictly</em> exist, we can find a way to think such that the transforms of these functions do exist in a practical sense. This is by considering them <em>in the limit</em>.</p><p>Consider a periodic function whose transform would strictly not exist, such as \(P(x) = \sin(x) \), since
$$
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |P(x)|\,\mathrm{d}x
$$
would not converge.</p><p>We could modify this function ever so slightly by multiplication with a <em>very</em> broad Gaussian envelope \(\exp(-\alpha x^2)\), where \(\alpha\) is a small positive number, then this modified version may have a transform. As we let \(\alpha \rightarrow 0\), then we approach \(P\) in the limit.
$$
\int_{-\infty}^\infty |e^{-\alpha x^2} P(x)|\,\mathrm{d}x
$$</p><p>As \(\alpha \rightarrow 0\) the transform may still not exist for all \(s\), however, we can still be quite productive with the sequence of transforms that do exist as we approach this limit. Therefore, we can practically use the Fourier transform for all physical systems that we might consider. We&rsquo;ll revisit this in more detail when we talk about Fourier series, line spectra, and the sampling theorem.</p><h3 id=oddness-evenness-and-complex-conjugates>Oddness, Evenness, and Complex Conjugates</h3><figure><img src=even-odd.png alt="An even function \(E(x)\) and an odd function \(O(x)\), followed by their sum.

$$
E(-x) = E(x)
$$
and are symmetrical.</p><p><strong>Odd functions</strong> have
$$
O(-x) = -O(x)
$$
and are antisymmetrical.</p><p>The sum of even and odd functions is, in general, neither even nor odd.</p><p>Any function \(f(x)\) can be split unambiguously into it&rsquo;s odd and even parts, though, where
$$
E(x) = \frac{1}{2} \left [ f(x) + f(-x) \right]
$$
and
$$
O(x) = \frac{1}{2} \left [ f(x) - f(-x) \right]
$$
and so we have
$$
f(x) = E(x) + O(x),
$$
where both \(E\) and \(O\) are in general complex-valued.</p><p>Evenness and oddness are very useful because we can these definitions to re-write the Fourier transform as
$$
F(s) = 2 \int_0^\infty E(x) \cos(2 \pi x s)\,\mathrm{d}x - 2 i \int_0^\infty O(x) \sin (2 \pi x s)\,\mathrm{d}x.
$$</p><p>We see that</p><ol><li>If a function is even, its transform is even</li><li>If a function is odd, its transform is odd</li></ol><p>and other results summarized by Bracewell in Chapter 2:</p><figure><img src=ft-relationships.png alt="If a function has the characteristics in the left column, then its Fourier transform has the characteristics in the right column.

The function itself is simple, so this is mainly an exercise in choosing the right limits

F(s) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-i 2 \pi x s}\,\mathrm{d}x
$$</p><p>$$
F(s) = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} e^{-i 2 \pi x s}\,\mathrm{d}x

$$
F(s) = \int_{-1/2}^{1/2} \cos(2 \pi x s) + i \sin(2 \pi x s) \,\mathrm{d}x
$$
and visually seen that the \(\sin\) term would eventually cancel itself out, or we could have relied upon the fact that we know \(\Pi(x)\) is an even function (\(O(x) = 0\)) and used
$$
F(s) = 2 \int_0^\infty E(x) \cos(2 \pi x s)\,\mathrm{d}x - 2 i \int_0^\infty O(x) \sin (2 \pi x s)\,\mathrm{d}x.
$$
to yield
$$
F(s) = 2 \int_0^{1/2} \cos(2 \pi x s)\,\mathrm{d}x
$$</p><p>$$
F(s) = 2 \Big |_0^{1/2} \frac{\sin 2 \pi x s}{2 \pi s} = \frac{\sin \pi s}{\pi s} = \mathrm{sinc}(s)
$$</p><p>Note that we (and Bracewell) define
$$
\mathrm{sinc}(s) = \frac{\sin \pi s}{\pi s}
$$
this is called the normalized sinc function, and (IMO) is the most useful because of it&rsquo;s nice Fourier pair relationships. There is also the &ldquo;unnormalized&rdquo; sinc function, which doesn&rsquo;t have the factors of \(\pi\) in it, but we won&rsquo;t use that in this course. The <strong>normalized sinc function</strong> has the properties that</p><ul><li>its peak is equal to 1 \(\mathrm{sinc}(0) = 1\)</li><li>its &ldquo;nulls&rdquo; are located at non-zero integer values of \(n\) for \(\mathrm{sinc}(n)\)</li><li>its integral from \(-\infty,\infty\) is equal to 1</li></ul><p>So we have the Fourier pair:
$$
\Pi(x) \leftrightharpoons \mathrm{sinc}(s)
$$
The unit rectangle (or boxcar) function has the Fourier transform pair of a normalized sinc function.</p><p>This is also the same relationship that we introduced in the first lecture: the far field electric field pattern (sinc) is the Fourier transform of the electric field illuminating the aperture of the telescope (boxcar).</p><h3 id=gaussian>Gaussian</h3><p>How about the Fourier transform of a Gaussian function?
$$
f(x) = \exp \left ( -\frac{x^2}{2 a ^2} \right )
$$</p><p>$$
F(s) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \left ( -\frac{x^2}{2 a ^2} \right ) \exp (-i 2 \pi x s)\,\mathrm{d}x
$$</p><p>$$
F(s) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \left ( -\frac{x^2}{2 a ^2} -i 2 \pi x s \right )\,\mathrm{d}x
$$</p><p>Usually, when I see something like this, my standard approach is to start browsing books of integrals like <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradshteyn_and_Ryzhik>Gradshteyn and Ryzhik</a> for ideas about how I might rearrange the integrand and successfully evaluate the integral. I&rsquo;d usually just go for this. But, in this case, we can actually do something using a trick you probably learned in jr. high school, called <a href=https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/completing-square.html>completing the square</a>.</p><p>Ok, so we&rsquo;ve got terms in the exponent with \(x^2\) and \(x\), and an equation that looks like
$$
a x^2 + bx + c = 0
$$
which we want to turn into something that looks like
$$
a(x + d)^2 + e = 0.
$$</p><p>The answer is that
$$
d = \frac{b}{2a}
$$
and
$$
e = c - \frac{b^2}{4 a}
$$
such that our rearranged exponent becomes
$$
-\left [ \frac{x^2}{2 a ^2} + i 2 \pi x s \right ] = -[(x - 2i \pi a^2 s)^2 + 4 \pi^2 a^4 s^2]/2a^2
$$
Why was this useful? Well, the integral is over \(x\), so we can pull out all terms that do not depend on \(x\), giving us a rearranged integral of
$$
F(s) = \exp(-2 \pi^2 a^2 s^2 ) \int_{-\infty}^\infty \exp \left (-\frac{(x - 2 i \pi a^2 s)^2}{2 a^2} \right)\,\mathrm{d}x
$$</p><p>Here it is helpful to remember your Gaussian integration formulas such that
$$
\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-a(x + b)^2}\,\mathrm{d}x = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a}}.
$$</p><p>Thus, the integral contributes another factor of \(\sqrt{2 \pi} a\) and the final result is</p><p>$$
F(s) = \sqrt{2 \pi} a \exp(-2 \pi^2 a^2 s^2 )
$$</p><p>What functional form is this? This is another Gaussian, though the normalization and standard deviation are a bit different! So, we see that the Gaussian function is a Fourier transform pair with itself.</p><p>Hopefully now you have a taste of how to compute Fourier transforms. At its most basic, it&rsquo;s just a matter of setting up and evaluating the integral. For many function forms, you can use integration strategies to arrive at analytic solutions. As a practical matter, in the next lecture we&rsquo;ll see how we can evaluate this integral numerically.</p><h2 id=convolution>Convolution</h2><p>The convolution of two functions \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\) is defined as
$$
\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(u) g(x - u)\,\mathrm{d}u
$$
and is frequently written using the \(*\) symbol. The convolution produces a new function, so we have
$$
h(x) = f(x) * g(x).
$$</p><p>Convolution as a process is very useful to think of graphically</p><figure><img src=convolution-1.png alt="A graphical representation of the convolution of two functions \(f(x)\) and \(g(x)\).

You may be quite familiar with this concept as a &ldquo;delta-function,&rdquo; especially in the context of quantum physics. Physically speaking, things like &ldquo;point masses&rdquo;, &ldquo;point charges,&rdquo; and (astrophysically speaking) &ldquo;point sources&rdquo; do not physically exist, but they are very useful concepts.

f(a) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) \delta(x - a)\,\mathrm{d}x^\prime.
