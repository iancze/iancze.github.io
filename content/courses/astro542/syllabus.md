Office hours by appointment.

Teaching assistant: TBN

## Objectives

The interstellar medium (ISM) is the space between the stars. This space is far from empty, however, and consists of large reservoirs of atomic and molecular gas and solids in the form of "dust" that mediate or contribute to many important astrophysical processes such as star formation, planet formation, stellar feedback, and stellar death/supernovae. Considered in aggregate, these processes are important on galactic- (and even intergalactic-) scales, influencing the distribution of giant molecular clouds and stellar populations. As such, Astro 542 is at once a course about *nothing* and a course about *everything*. We will cover the astrophysical processes that govern the interactions between the ISM and its many astrophysical interfaces.

## Format 
ASTRO 542 meets three times a week on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in [Davey Laboratory, Rm. 541](https://map.psu.edu/?id=1134#!m/274769?s/davey%20lab?ct/33177,25403,26748,26749,26750,27255) from 9:05am to 9:55am ET (prompt). Following university guidelines, the course is currently scheduled to meet in person. Specific guidance regarding masking policies for vaccinated/unvaccinated individuals will be forthcoming closer to the beginning of the semester. Remote formats of the course may at times be necessary depending on the status of the COVID-19 pandemic.


## Textbook 

This course has one required textbook:

* **Title**: *Physics of the Interstellar and Intergalactic Medium*

## Problem sets, ALMA Proposal, Exams, and Grading

### Problem sets

Problem sets will be assigned approximately every 3-4 weeks.

Please turn in homeworks in electronic format (i.e. `.pdf`) to Ian by email at ipc5094@psu.edu with the subject line `ASTRO 542 problem set`. Handwritten solutions are fine, but please digitize your submission using a department scanner or a smartphone scanner app (e.g., [Adobe Scan](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat/mobile/scanner-app.html)).

Due dates will be set to correspond to the beginning of a class period (i.e., 9:05am).

#### Problem set late policy
* one day late: 5%
* two days late: 10%
* three days late: 25%
* more than 72 hours late: no credit
 
If extenuating circumstances arise and you will be unable to complete the homework on time, contact me *before* the homework deadline and we can arrange an extension. 

#### Problem set collaboration policy

You are welcome to collaborate and work through the problem sets. However, each student must complete the final write up on their own, i.e., a completed problem set should not be duplicated verbatim between students.

It should go without saying that students may not collaborate on exams.


### Paper presentation

Each student will give one 15 minute presentation with 5 minutes of questions (equivalent to journal club talk) on an article from the last 1-2 years. Please select an article submitted to the Astrophysical Journal, Astronomical Journal, MNRAS, or A&A that has *completed the referee process* (i.e., is available from the journal itself, or is labeled "accepted" on the arXiv). Chosen articles should fall under the subjects that have been covered by the intervening topics since the previous student talk. To select a paper, you can search for papers in [ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#) based in terms (or combinations of them) appearing in titles or abstracts (e.g., extinction, molecular cloud). 

Each student should provide the instructor with the two dates that they prefer by Monday, August 30th. The instructor will then assign one date to each student. By one week out from your presentation date, you should have selected your paper and emailed Ian with a link to it.

Good talks will 
* Provide a cogent introduction to the subfield of the paper 
* Introduce the key supporting background material, including any relevant equations or seminal figures from related works
* Explain the key observational or theoretical (as applicable) instruments/methodologies 
* Discuss the scientific findings of the paper
* Finish within the allotted time (+/- 2 minutes)
* Adequately answer questions raised by the instructor and students

It is a wise idea to practice your presentation from start to finish "live" to make sure the timing is correct, as talks that are wildly under/over time will have a difficult time receiving full credit.

### ALMA proposal 

Distributed review.

Dual anonymous review. 



### Exams

Exam makeup: If you are unable to attend class on the date of an exam, please contact Ian to schedule a makeup exam. 

## Course Calendar

For full information, see the [Course Schedule]({{<relref "schedule" >}}). Important dates to keep in mind are the three mid-term exams, scheduled during class periods.

## Academic Integrity
Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’ dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.

Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.

## Disability Accommodation 
Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. Student Disability Resources (SDR) website provides contact information for every Penn State campus (Links to an external site.). For further information, please visit [Student Disability Resources website](http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/).

In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation: See [documentation guidelines](http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/applying-for-services/documentation-guidelines). If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early as possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations.

## Counseling and Psychological Services
Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs that may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional wellbeing. The university offers a variety of confidential services to help you through difficult times, including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, consultations, online chats, and mental health screenings. These services are provided by staff who welcome all students and embrace a philosophy respectful of clients’ cultural and religious backgrounds, and sensitive to differences in race, ability, gender identity and sexual orientation.

## Educational Equity and Reporting Bias
Penn State takes great pride to foster a diverse and inclusive environment for students, faculty, and staff. Acts of intolerance, discrimination, or harassment due to age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender identity, national origin, race, religious belief, sexual orientation, or veteran status are not tolerated and can be reported through Educational Equity via the [Report Bias webpage](http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias/).

*Whom should I contact if I need additional assistance?*
I encourage you to be in contact with your academic adviser for specific needs you might have outside this course.
