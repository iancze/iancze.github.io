From Kevin re: JWST proposals:

Background on the topic, beginning broad and narrowing to the question addressed by the proposal
Previous work on the proposal’s question
How new progress can be made
Proposed observations to address the proposal’s question
Describe selection of targets and justify their number
Describe the observations, the analysis of the data, and how they will be interpreted and used to answer the proposal’s question
In the technical section, describe all details of the observations: instrument, filters, dispersers, apertures, exposure times, positions, dithering/mapping strategy, explanation of how exposure times selected (e.g., to achieve a certain SNR), total observing time, observing constraints (e.g., instrument orientation)
Justify the telescope; why can’t observations be performed with smaller/ground-based telescopes?
