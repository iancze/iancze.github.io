                <p class="fragment fade-in">
                    The interstellar medium course is at once a course about nothing and a course about everything.
                    We're talking about the <em>space between things</em>, some of the least dense
                    parts of the galaxy. But we're also going to touch on nearly all aspects of astrophysics:
                </p>

                <ul class="fragment fade-in">
                    <li>quantum mechanics of atoms and molecules</li>
                    <li>radiative transfer</li>
                    <li>star formation</li>
                    <li>galactic stellar populations</li>
                    <li>planet formation</li>
                    <li>and even cosmology (a tiny bit)</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What is this course? (cont)</h2>

                <p>
                    The ISM is fundamentally about the <em>interactions</em> between all of these more
                    easily-defined "units" of astrophysics.</p>

                The science lectures in this course will basically fall into one or two categories:
                <ul>
                    <li class="fragment fade-in">coverage/review of fundamental concepts/theories (e.g., quantum
                        mechanics, radiative transfer,
                        etc...)</li>
                    <li class="fragment fade-in">applying/integrating those concepts to understanding the interstellar
                        medium (e.g., dust
                        emission,
                        star formation,
                        etc...)</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="fragment fade-in">
                    We'll be talking about many fundamental astrophysical concepts in some detail (warning: not as much
                    detail as courses
                    designed to cover these subjects, but enough detail so that you'll be able to follow along if you
                    haven't taken these
                    courses already, or if you forgot)!

                                ### Interstellar absorption lines

                                * Hartmann (1904): stationary narrow line in a broad oscillating Ca II stellar line in a
                                binary
                                \\(\delta\\)-Ori (O9.5 star).
                                * Up until space astronomy, high spectral resolutions of absorption lines in stars was
                                the main way to
                                study cool interstellar clouds
                                * UV satellites like Copernicus, then IUE, HST, and FUSE allowed main transitions of HI,
                                Lyman alpha,
                                H2, etc. to be studied.

                                ## Dark clouds

                                Modern image:

                                {{< figure src="barnard_68.jpg" link="https://www.eso.org/public/images/eso9934b/"
                                    caption="The dark cloud B68 at different wavelegths. Credit: ESO">}}

                                    What's going on here? Extinction diminishes with wavelength. Also, centers of clouds
                                    are denser than
                                    peripheries.

                                    We see these in the visible light image of the milky way.
