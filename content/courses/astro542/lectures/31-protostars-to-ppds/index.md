Congratulations! We've finished the Draine textbook!

The next two lectures will take a closer look at the protostellar phase, and, specifically, the protoplanetary disk phase.

The following lectures will use powerpoint slides, which will be posted to the course canvas page.

Questions:
How are disks observed and why do they ‘look’ different at different wavelengths, and when observing gas vs solids?
How do disk properties depend on their local environment (including the kind of star)?
What sets the disk temperature structure?
What are some causes of dynamics in disks, i.e. how gas and solids move radially and/or vertically?
How can you observe grains growing to pebbles (the first step of planet formation)? What are barriers to grain growth?
In what ways do disk structures divert from smooth ‘similarity-solution’ or power-laws? What are some proposed causes of this ‘sub-structure’? How can ‘sub-structure’ affect disk dynamics?
