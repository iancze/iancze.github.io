What is dust? From the observations, it must be made refractory materials that are solid under typical ISM conditions. And, it must be made of relatively common (in an astrophysical sense) material.

"Refractory material" is something that is resistant to decomposition by heat, pressure, and retains strength and form at (relatively) high temperatures. 

Total mass of interstellar gas in our galaxy is 
$$
M_\mathrm{gas} \approx 7 \times 10^9 \\, M_\odot
$$
and 
$$
M_\mathrm{H} \approx 5 \times 10^9 \\, M_\odot
$$
is hydrogen.

From optical extinction and infrared emission, it's estimated that the total mass of dust is 
$$
M_\mathrm{dust} = 0.01 M_\mathrm{H} = \approx 5 \times 10^7 \\, M_\odot.
$$

At solar abundance, the total mass of metals is 
$$
M_\mathrm{metals} = 0.022\\,M_\mathrm{H}.
$$
That means that we require *about half* of all of the heavy elements in the ISM to be condensed into solid dust grains. By this bit of accounting, that means we'd be hard pressed to find that scarce elements like beryllium or uranium to contribute significantly to interstellar dust. Rather, we should be turning our attention to common refractory elements like carbon, magnesium, silicon, and iron, which will be combined with more volatile elements like hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.

## Composition Possibilities

### Elemental grains 
* elemental grains of magnesium or iron
* carbon grains: amorphous or crystalline like graphite or diamonds
* silicon grains: either amorphous or crystalline

### Silicates
* family of minerals that contain silicon, oxygen, and some combination of metals (in the non-astronomy sense of the word) like Fe and Mg.

### Carbonates
* family of minerals with carbon, oxygen, and some combination of metals.

### Other possibilities
* silicon carbide 
* ices: water, CO2, methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3)


## How do we know?

### Composition 

Measure what elements are presence in the *gas-phase* by looking at line-of-sight absorption by background stars. Towards the star Zeta Ophiuchi, we find that 
* carbon is 35% of solar value
* oxygen is 55% 
* magnesium at 11%
* silicon at 5%
* iron at 0.4%

These depletion values are consistent with 30% by mass of dust being composed of carbon and carbonaceous materials, and 70% by mass of dust being composed of silicates.

The two main types of silicates are *pyroxene* and *olivine*. Depending on the exact numbers of atoms, subtypes of these silicates are called enstatite, ferrosilite, forsterite, and fayalite. These are very common minerals on Earth. For example, igneous rock basalt makes up the oceanic crust. They are also very common extraterrestrially, like in meteorites. Pyroxene and olivine have different reflectance spectra, so it's possible to distinguish them from a distance.

However, determining compositions of dust grains solely from optical properties is tricky, since the index of refraction of many materials can be altered by the inclusion of small amounts of impurities, or by exposure to cosmic rays.

Silicates do have a strong infrared absorption/emission feature at 9.7 microns, which results from the stretching mode of Si-O, and an 18 micron feature from the bending mode of O-Si-O.

### Shape

Dust grains can't actually be spherical, because we know that dust can polarize starlight.

We see that polarization is larger for stars with greater redenning, and that stars in a given region of the sky have similar polarization directions, making it clear that polarization is produced by the ISM.

For example, the [polarization signature from dust](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.16830) threw a wrench in the CMB polarization experiment BICEP2 (a potential observable from inflation).

A simple approximation is to consider "ellipsoidal dust" (see Draine 22.3.1), but most likely interstellar dust has a large, fractal-like structure with a large porosity (like the interplanetary dust from comets).



### Size distribution

Typically power-law distribution
$$
\frac{d n_\mathrm{gr}}{d a} \propto a^{-\beta}
$$
where \\(a\\) is an effective radius. Mathis, Rumpl, and Nordsieck 1977 found that \\(\beta = 3.5\\) gave a good fit for the extinction curve from 0.1 to 1 micron (UV, optical + near IR), assuming that grains were made of two different materials
1) graphite
2) silicon carbide, magnetite, iron, olivine, or pyroxene.

The maximum grain size was \\(a_\mathrm{max} \approx 0.25\\,\mu m\\).

## Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)

Infrared emission features reveal the existence of *large molecules* called PAHs that are located in regions where dust grains are found. These are hydrocarbons because they are made of hydrogen and carbon atoms, and they are polycyclic because they contain three or more benzene rings. The are aromatic because molecules containing benzene are often smelly!

Narrow emission features ranging from 3 to 20 microns are produced by the stretching and bending modes of the C-H bonds in PAHs.

In the limit that these keep getting bigger, you have graphene. Crystalline graphite consists of regularly stacked sheets of graphene held together by weak van der Waals forces. 

The mass of PAHs is estimated to be about 3% of the total dust mass.
