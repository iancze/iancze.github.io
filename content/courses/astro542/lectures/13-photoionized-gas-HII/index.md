Recall ionization state from previous lecture. In the warm ionized medium \\(x_e \sim 0.7\\) and in the hot ionized medium \\(x_e \sim 1\\).

We'll cover ionization and its inverse process recombination.

There is the warm ionized medium (WIM) which is \\(T \sim 8000\\) K and \\( n \approx 0.2\\;\mathrm{cm}^{-3}\\). 
There are also H II regions and planetary nebulae (a denser analog to the WIM) that contain many diagnostic tools (in terms of emission) that allow us to determine densities, temperatures, compositions, and ionization states.

**first ionization energy**: energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron from a neutral atom in its ground state. For hydrogen, this is 13.6 eV, for helium it's 24.6 eV, for oxygen its 13.6 eV, for carbon its 11.3 eV, see R&P Table 1.2.

*question*: why do we usually care about the energy required to 

Does this mean that the relative populations in hydrogen are rare, i.e., in ISM conditions we always have way more \\(n=1\\) than \\(n=2\\) hydrogen?
