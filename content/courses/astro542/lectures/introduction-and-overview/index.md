The Interstellar medium course is at once a course about nothing and a course about everything. What I mean by that is we're talking about the *space between things*, some of the least dense parts of the galaxy. But we're also going to touch on nearly all aspects of astrophysics:

* radiative transfer
* molecular emission
* star formation 
* planet formation
* galactic stellar populations 
* and even cosmology (slightly)

That's because this course is fundamentally about the interactions between all of these better-defined "units" of astrophysics. So it's important to take a systems-engineering approach to this. We'll be talking about all of these areas in some detail (warning: not as much detail as courses designed to cover these subjects, but enough detail so that you'll be able to follow along if you haven't taken these courses already, or if you forgot)!


## Course Syllabus 

### Format
* 3 mid-term exams
* no final

## Course Schedule

First 1/3 of the course is a review/extension of radiative transfer with a focus on the processes necessary for studying these regions.

## Rough tour of the ISM

* Range of densities and locations
* Nomenclature around HI, HII, H_2
* Atoms, molecules, complex molecules
* Types of emission mechanisms and spectrum to observe
