The Interstellar medium course is at once a course about nothing and a course about everything. What I mean by that is we're talking about the *space between things*, some of the least dense parts of the galaxy. But we're also going to touch on nearly all aspects of astrophysics:

* radiative transfer
* molecular emission
* star formation 
* planet formation
* galactic stellar populations 
* and even cosmology (slightly)

That's because this course is fundamentally about the interactions between all of these better-defined "units" of astrophysics. So it's important to take a systems-engineering approach to this. We'll be talking about all of these areas in some detail (warning: not as much detail as courses designed to cover these subjects, but enough detail so that you'll be able to follow along if you haven't taken these courses already, or if you forgot)!


## Course Syllabus 

### Format
* 3 midterm exams (total 45%)
* three problem sets (total 20%)

## Course Schedule

* **First third**: review/extension of radiative transfer with a focus on the processes necessary for understanding the components of the interstellar medium
* **Second third**: star formation, generally: clouds, astrochemistry, shocks, CO surveys, protostars
* **Final third**: protoplanetary disks, planet formation, exoplanets, radio astronomy, ALMA proposals

## Rough tour of the ISM

* Range of densities and locations
* Nomenclature around HI, HII, H_2
* Atoms, molecules, complex molecules
* Types of emission mechanisms and spectrum to observe

## Properties of the ISM 
* primarily = the disks of galaxies
* Gigantic range of \\(T\\) (\\(10 - 10^6\\)) and number density \\(n\\) (\\(10^{-3} - 10^{-6} \mathrm{cm}^{-3}\\))
* wide range of ionization states
* spatially inhomogeneous
* roughly solar abundances 
* multi-phase
* far from equilibrium/steady-state

## Phases of the ISM
(numbers on slide)

* HII regions
* Warm ionized medium
* Hot ionized medium
* Cold neutral medium 
* Warm neutral medium 
* Molecular clouds
* Tielens 2005, Table 1.1

ISM is mostly hydrogen. Following Draine. Hydrogen states by mass.

## Sources of Energy in ISM

* Photons
* CRs
* Magnetic fields
* Kinetic energy

## Historical beginnings of ISM observations

### Nebulae

* Orion nebulae (1610), gas clouds
* Messier catalog (1787) contains many nebulae
* Kant and Laplace (1755/1797) nebular hypothesis
* Henry Draper (1880) photographs orion nebula

### Interstellar absorption lines

* Hartmann (1904): stationary narrow line in a broad oscillating Ca II stellar line in a binary \\(\delta\\)-Ori (O9.5 star).
* Up until space astronomy, high spectral resolutions of absorption lines in stars was the main way to study cool interstellar clouds
* UV satellites like Copernicus, then IUE, HST, and FUSE allowed main transitions of HI, Lyman alpha, H2, etc. to be studied.

## Dark clouds

What's going on here? Extinction diminishes with wavelength. Also, centers of clouds are denser than peripheries.

We see these in the visible light image of the milky way.
