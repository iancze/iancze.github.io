Draine Ch. 12, 13, & 14

## Interstellar Radiation Fields

* Draine Ch. 12

Stuff is out there in space, it's not just sitting isolated. In fact, it's getting incoming radiation. We'll walk through the spectrum of this radiation and the dominant sources at each wavelength.

Of course, the intensity of the incoming radiation very much depends on your *location* in the Galaxy and *where* you're looking. Remember, \\(I_\nu\\) is a function of *position* \\(\vec{x}\\) and *direction* \\(\Omega\\).

, if you're very near an H II region, or partially shielded by a molecular cloud, etc... you will see a different spectrum.

- Walk through each of the components, their dominant sources, and show the two different spectral energy distributions.
- Show the "plates" with pretty all-sky pictures

## Ionization Processes

* Draine Ch. 13

- [ ] Discuss how the ionization state of the medium varies so much (bullets)
- [ ] Outline the processes that change ionization state (bolded)
- [ ] make sure we understand ionization relative to what we discussed in Ch 2

Cosmic rays important.

## Recombination of Ions with Electrons

* Draine Ch. 14

- [ ] List recombination processes
- [ ] Briefly explain each
- [ ] Show figures where relevant
