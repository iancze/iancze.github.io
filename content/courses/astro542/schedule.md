43 classes total

Should the midterms be take home, or in class?
Kevin had them in-class.
Also had 4 classes devoted to 7 student presentations.
Had two classes related to discussion of JWST proposals. Can we have a "meta" discussion about what made a good/bad ALMA proposal?

So that makes 43 - (3 + 4 + 2) to divide up the remaining topics.

Can we do ALMA proposals? I think so. Kevin had this count for 15%. I can basically do an entire lecture or two which is like the ALMA ambassadors prep.
