## Objective

Interferometric astrophysical observations are a vast and deep topic. The goal of this course is to help students develop a **practical understanding** of how radio interferometers **observe an astrophysical source**, build a **mathematical foundation** for working with **complex-valued, Fourier-plane data**, and survey some of the many approaches that are used to **investigate astrophysical phenomena**, focusing on **forward-modeling** and **regularized maximum likelihood** techniques.

## Instructor

* Professor (Dr.) Ian Czekala (he/him/his)
* *Email*: ipc5094@psu.edu or iczekala@psu.edu (alias).

Office hours by appointment.

**If you are in any way feeling ill or suspect you might have been contact with an individual infected with COVID, *please* stay home and seek medical care.** We plan on posting all lecture notes, and we will work with you to provide you with the course materials you need.

## Course Calendar and Closure Policies

ASTRO 589 meets **once a week on Wednesdays from 10:10am to 11:00am ET (prompt) in Davey Lab Room 538**.

For full information on lecture dates and topics, see the [Course Schedule]({{<relref "schedule" >}}).

If campus should be closed (e.g. for a weather-related event or COVID precautions), the instructor will provide instructions via email on course lecture format (possibly remote, keeping the same schedule) and examinations/assignments (due dates to be rescheduled *no earlier than 48 hours* after closure announcement).

## Assignments and Project

### Course Grade

The course grade will be based on

* problem sets (55%)
* group project and presentation (45%)

### Problem sets

Problem sets will be assigned approximately every 2-3 weeks.

Please turn in homeworks in `.PDF` format to Ian by email at ipc5094@psu.edu with the subject line `ASTRO 589 problem set`. Handwritten solutions are fine, but please digitize your submission using a department scanner or a smartphone scanner app (e.g., [Adobe Scan](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat/mobile/scanner-app.html)).

Due dates will be set to correspond to the beginning of a class period (i.e., 10:10am).

### Programming

Some problem sets, especially those dealing with the CASA radio astronomy software, will require basic familiarity with the Python programming language. Outside of the CASA problem sets, students are encouraged to use whatever programming language they are most comfortable with.

#### Problem set late policy

The following percentages will be deducted from your score

* one day late: 5%
* two days late: 10%
* three days late: 25%
* more than 72 hours late: no credit

If extenuating circumstances arise such that you will be unable to complete the homework on time, please contact Ian *before* the homework deadline and we can most likely arrange an extension.

#### Problem set collaboration policy

You are welcome to collaborate and work through the problem sets. However, each student must complete the final write up on their own, i.e., no problem set should be duplicated verbatim between students.

It should go without saying that students may not collaborate on exams.

### Paper presentation

Students will form groups of 2-3 individuals, depending on course enrollment, for their course projects.

Each group should provide the instructor with the two dates that they prefer by Wednesday, September 21st. The instructor will then assign one presentation date to each group.

You should notify the instructor of your project topic at least two weeks prior to your presentation date to confirm that it is an acceptable choice.

You will need to give a comprehensive lecture on your topic, which should take a full 35 minutes of our class period, leaving 15 minutes for detalied questions and answers. Should consist of introductory background, connection to course material covered (if applicable) and a substantially new bit of analysis or theoretical advancement.

Good talks will

* Provide a cogent introduction to the subfield of the paper
* Introduce the key supporting background material, including any relevant equations or seminal figures from related works
* Explain the key observational or theoretical instruments/methodologies (as applicable)
* Discuss the scientific findings of the paper, and their implications for the broader astrophysical subfield
* Finish the presentation within the allotted time (50 +/- 2 minutes)
* Adequately answer questions raised by the instructor and students

It is a wise idea to practice your presentation from start to finish "live" to make sure your timing is correct. Groups whose talks are wildly under/over time will find it difficult to achieve full credit.

## Reference Materials

There are many additional resources that will be helpful during this course (and beyond) and will be called out in the course at the appropriate juncture. Many of these resources are freely available online or through the [University library](https://libraries.psu.edu/).

## Masking Policy

We encourage you to get COVID-19 vaccinated and follow University policies on masking, especially in indoor spaces. In consultation with background rates in Centre County, masks may be required part or all of the fall semester (see policy below).

*University policy*: Penn State University requires everyone to wear a face mask in all university buildings, including classrooms, regardless of vaccination status. ALL STUDENTS MUST wear a mask appropriately (i.e., covering both your mouth and nose) while you are indoors on campus.  This is to protect your health and safety as well as the health and safety of your classmates, instructor, and the university community.   Anyone attending class without a mask will be asked to put one on or leave.  Instructors may end class if anyone present refuses to appropriately wear a mask for the duration of class. Students who refuse to wear masks appropriately may face disciplinary action for Code of Conduct violations.  If you feel you cannot wear a mask during class, please speak with your adviser immediately about your options for altering your schedule.

## Academic Integrity

Academic integrity is the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’ dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.

Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.

## Disability Accommodation

Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. Student Disability Resources (SDR) website provides contact information for every Penn State campus (Links to an external site.). For further information, please visit [Student Disability Resources website](http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/).

In order to receive consideration for reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake interview, and provide documentation: See [documentation guidelines](http://equity.psu.edu/student-disability-resources/applying-for-services/documentation-guidelines). If the documentation supports your request for reasonable accommodations, your campus disability services office will provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early as possible. You must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations.

## Counseling and Psychological Services
