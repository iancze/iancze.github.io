Images are real, therefore the real part of the visibility function must always be even and the imaginary part odd. The visibility function is Hermitian.

* 2D fourier transform


and then revisit some questions that also apply to the DFT:

* What have we assumed about the periodic nature of the samples?
* Windowing / response / filters
* Dynamic power spectrum / spectrogram
