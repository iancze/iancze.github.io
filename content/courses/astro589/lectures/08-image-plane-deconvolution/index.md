* Image Synthesis: Dirty image [[20210223144503]] image-synthesis-dirty
* Dirty image, idea of convolution of PSF + source

### Gridding

* Brief introduction to "gridding"
* [[20210204160702]] gridding
* [[20210625182413]] nufft
* Convolutional resampling
* Uniform vs. Natural weighting/gridding
* Briggs robust weighting
* and effects on PSF, sensitivity

Can we drive home the idea that we have different sensitivity to different spatial scales? This is where the spectrogram concept really comes in handy.
