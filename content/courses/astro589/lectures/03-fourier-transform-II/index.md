Review of last time:

* Defined Fourier transform, inverse
* Introduced convolution, impluse symbol, and theorems

This lecture:

* Anything we didn't cover last one
* Nyquist sampling theorem
* Discrete Fourier transform
* Windowing / response / filters
* 2D fourier transform

Can we tease/introduce the spectrogram figure here?
