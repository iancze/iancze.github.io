I am a lecturer in the [School of Physics and Astronomy](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/) at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/) in Scotland. The research interests of our group include planet formation, protoplanetary disks, radio interferometry, synthesis imaging, high resolution spectroscopy, radial velocity, hierarchical Bayesian inference, and machine learning, among other topics. To learn more, get to know the [members of our group](people) and view our [refereed publications](publications).

Before July 2023, I was an assistant professor in the [Astronomy and Astrophysics department](https://science.psu.edu/astro) and [Institute for Computational and Data Sciences](https://www.icds.psu.edu/) Co-Hire at [Pennsylvania State University](https://science.psu.edu/), located in [State College, PA, USA](https://goo.gl/maps/6vgTr6pz8frhyLTm6). Penn State's Science Journal featured our research in an article about [planet formation](https://science.psu.edu/science-journal/winter-2021/FlatSolarSystems) and described our efforts developing [imaging algorithms for ALMA](https://science.psu.edu/science-journal/winter-2021/improving-analysis-astronomy-data).
