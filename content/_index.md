I am an assistant professor in the [Astronomy and Astrophysics department](https://science.psu.edu/astro) at [Pennsylvania State University](https://science.psu.edu/), located in [State College, PA, USA](https://goo.gl/maps/6vgTr6pz8frhyLTm6). I am also an ICDS Co-Hire of Penn State's [Institute for Computational and Data Sciences](https://www.icds.psu.edu/) (ICDS). I am affiliated with Penn State's [Center for Astrostatistics](https://astrostatistics.psu.edu/) and [Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds](https://exoplanets.psu.edu/).

My research interests include planet formation, protoplanetary disks, radio interferometry, synthesis imaging, high resolution spectroscopy, radial velocity, hierarchical Bayesian inference, and machine learning, among other topics. Here is a recent press release from NRAO highlighting some of our work on planet formation in circumbinary disk systems:

Penn State's Science Journal recently featured our research in an article about [planet formation](https://science.psu.edu/science-journal/winter-2021/FlatSolarSystems) and described our efforts developing [imaging algorithms for ALMA](https://science.psu.edu/science-journal/winter-2021/improving-analysis-astronomy-data).
