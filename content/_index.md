I am an assistant professor in the [Astronomy and Astrophysics department](https://science.psu.edu/astro) at [Pennsylvania State University](https://science.psu.edu/), located in [State College, PA, USA](https://goo.gl/maps/6vgTr6pz8frhyLTm6). I am also an ICDS Co-Hire of Penn State's [Institute for Computational and Data Sciences](https://www.icds.psu.edu/) (ICDS) and affiliated with Penn State's [Center for Astrostatistics](https://astrostatistics.psu.edu/) and [Center for Exoplanets and Habitable Worlds](https://exoplanets.psu.edu/).

The research interests of our group include planet formation, protoplanetary disks, radio interferometry, synthesis imaging, high resolution spectroscopy, radial velocity, hierarchical Bayesian inference, and machine learning, among other topics. To learn more, get to know the [members of our group](people) and view our [refereed publications](publications).

Here is a recent press release from NRAO highlighting some of our work on planet formation in circumbinary disk systems:

Penn State's Science Journal recently featured our research in an article about [planet formation](https://science.psu.edu/science-journal/winter-2021/FlatSolarSystems) and described our efforts developing [imaging algorithms for ALMA](https://science.psu.edu/science-journal/winter-2021/improving-analysis-astronomy-data).
