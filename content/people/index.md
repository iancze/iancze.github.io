      link: https://briannazawadzki.github.io/
      blurb: In 2023, [Brianna](https://briannazawadzki.github.io/) completed her Ph.D. entitled "Investigating Planet Formation Through Simulation, Observation, And Machine Learning" at Pennsylvania State University. Her work at Penn State ranged from N-body planet formation simulations to ALMA observations of protoplanetary disks to development of regularized maximum likelihood imaging algorithms. Brianna is now a Brinson Prize Postdoctoral Fellow at Wesleyan University.
    - name: Kadri M. Nizam
      stage: former 
      src: Kadri_Nizam.png
      blurb: Kadri is a graduate student at Pennsylvania State University working on protoplanetary disk dynamics and machine learning for regularized maximum imaging algorithms. From 2021 - 2023, he worked on deep learning methods to emulate molecular line radiative transfer and contributed to the development of the MPoL project. He is now working on his Ph.D. as part of the BlackCAT X-ray telescope mission.
    - name: Zoe Ko
      stage: former 
      src: Zoe_Ko.png
      blurb: Zoe worked with our group as an undergraduate student and physics major at the University of California, Berkeley. She worked on high resolution stellar spectroscopy and radial velocity analysis for circumbinary protoplanetary disks. Zoe will begin a Ph.D. in Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University in 2024.
    - name: Tyler Quinn
      stage: former
