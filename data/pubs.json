        "abstract": "The mass of a star is the most fundamental parameter for its structure, evolution, and final fate. It is particularly important for any kind of stellar archaeology and characterization of exoplanets. There exist a variety of methods in astronomy to estimate or determine it. In this review we present a significant number of such methods, beginning with the most direct and model-independent approach using detached eclipsing binaries. We then move to more indirect and model-dependent methods, such as the quite commonly used isochrone or stellar track fitting. The arrival of quantitative asteroseismology has opened a completely new approach to determine stellar masses and to complement and improve the accuracy of other methods. We include methods for different evolutionary stages, from the pre-main sequence to evolved (super)giants and final remnants. For all methods uncertainties and restrictions will be discussed. We provide lists of altogether more than 200 benchmark stars with relative mass accuracies between [0.3 ,2 ]% for the covered mass range of M ∈[0.1 ,16 ] M<SUB>⊙</SUB> , 75 % of which are stars burning hydrogen in their core and the other 25 % covering all other evolved stages. We close with a recommendation how to combine various methods to arrive at a \"mass-ladder\" for stars.",

        "abstract": "We present sensitive ALMA observations of TWA 3, a nearby, young (∼10 Myr) hierarchical system composed of three pre-main-sequence M3-M4.5 stars. For the first time, we detected <SUP>12</SUP>CO and <SUP>13</SUP>CO J = 2-1 emissions from the circumbinary protoplanetary disk around TWA 3A. We jointly fit the protoplanetary disk velocity field, stellar astrometric positions, and stellar radial velocities to infer the architecture of the system. The Aa and Ab stars (0.29 ± 0.01 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and 0.24 ± 0.01 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, respectively) comprising the tight (P = 35 days) eccentric (e = 0.63 ± 0.01) spectroscopic binary are coplanar with their circumbinary disk (misalignment <6° with 68% confidence), similar to other short-period binary systems. From models of the spectral energy distribution, we found the inner radius of the circumbinary disk (r<SUB>inner</SUB> = 0.50-0.75 au) to be consistent with theoretical predictions of dynamical truncation r<SUB>cav</SUB>/a<SUB>inner</SUB> ≍ 3. The outer orbit of the tertiary star B (0.40 ± 0.28 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, a ∼ 65 ± 18 au, e = 0.3 ± 0.2) is not as well constrained as the inner orbit; however, orbits coplanar with the A system are still preferred (misalignment < 20°). To better understand the influence of the B orbit on the TWA 3A circumbinary disk, we performed SPH simulations of the system and found that the outer edge of the gas disk (r<SUB>outer</SUB> = 8.5 ± 0.2 au) is most consistent with truncation from a coplanar, circular, or moderately eccentric orbit, supporting the preference from the joint orbital fit.",

        "abstract": "In this era of Gaia and ALMA, dynamical stellar mass measurements, derived from spatially and spectrally resolved observations of the Keplerian rotation of circumstellar disks, provide benchmarks that are independent of observations of stellar characteristics and their uncertainties. These benchmarks can then be used to validate and improve stellar evolutionary models, the latter of which can lead to both imprecise and inaccurate mass predictions for pre-main-sequence, low-mass (≤0.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stars. We present the dynamical stellar masses derived from disks around three M stars (FP Tau, J0432+1827, and J1100-7619) using ALMA observations of <SUP>12</SUP>CO (J = 2-1) and <SUP>13</SUP>CO (J = 2-1) emission. These are the first dynamical stellar mass measurements for J0432+1827 and J1100-7619 (0.192 ± 0.005 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and 0.461 ± 0.057 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, respectively) and the most precise measurement for FP Tau (0.395 ± 0.012 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). Fiducial stellar evolutionary model tracks, which do not include any treatment of magnetic activity, agree with the dynamical stellar mass measurement of J0432+1827 but underpredict the mass by ∼60% for FP Tau and by ∼80% for J1100-7619. Possible explanations for the underpredictions include inaccurate assumptions of stellar effective temperature, undetected binarity for J1100-7619, and that fiducial stellar evolutionary models are not complex enough to represent these stars. In the former case, the stellar effective temperatures would need to be increased by amounts ranging from ∼40 to ∼340 K to reconcile the fiducial stellar evolutionary model predictions with the dynamically measured masses. In the latter case, we show that the dynamical masses can be reproduced using results from stellar evolutionary models with starspots, which incorporate fractional starspot coverage to represent the manifestation of magnetic activity. Folding in low-mass M stars from the literature and assuming that the stellar effective temperatures are imprecise but accurate, we find tentative evidence of a relationship between fractional starspot coverage and observed effective temperature for these young, cool stars.",

        "abstract": "We present new near-infrared Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) spectroscopy of HD 206893 B, a substellar companion orbiting within the debris disk of its F5V star. The J, H, K1, and K2 spectra from GPI demonstrate the extraordinarily red colors of the object, confirming it as the reddest substellar object observed to date. The significant flux increase throughout the infrared presents a challenging atmosphere to model with existing grids. Best-fit values vary from 1200 to 1800 K for effective temperature and from 3.0 to 5.0 for log(g), depending on which individual wavelength band is fit and which model suite is applied. The extreme redness of the companion can be partially reconciled by invoking a high-altitude layer of submicron dust particles, similar to dereddening approaches applied to the peculiar red field L dwarf population. However, reconciling the HD 206893 B spectra with even those of the reddest low-gravity L dwarf spectra still requires the contribution of additional atmospheric dust, potentially due to the debris disk environment in which the companion resides. Orbit fitting from 4 yr of astrometric monitoring is consistent with a ∼30 yr period, an orbital inclination of 147°, and a semimajor axis of 10 au, well within the estimated disk inner radius of ∼50 au. As one of a very few substellar companions imaged interior to a circumstellar disk, the properties of this system offer important dynamical constraints on companion–disk interaction and provide a benchmark for substellar and planetary atmospheric study.",

        "abstract": "Age is a fundamental parameter of stars, yet in many cases, ages of individual stars are presented without robust estimates of the uncertainty. We have developed a Bayesian framework, BAFFLES, to produce the age posterior for a star from its calcium emission strength (log( ${R}_{{HK}}^{{\\prime} }$ )) or lithium abundance (Li EW) and B - V color. We empirically determine the likelihood functions for calcium and lithium as functions of age from literature measurements of stars in benchmark clusters with well-determined ages. We use a uniform prior on age, which reflects a uniform star formation rate. The age posteriors we derive for several test cases are consistent with literature ages found from other methods. BAFFLES represents a robust method to determine the age posterior probability distribution for any field star with 0.45 ≤ B - V ≤ 0.9 and a measurement of ${R}_{{HK}}^{{\\prime} }$ and/or 0.35 ≤ B - V ≤ 1.9 and measured Li EW. We compile colors, ${R}_{{HK}}^{{\\prime} }$ , and Li EW from over 2630 nearby field stars from the literature, and present the derived BAFFLES age posterior for each star.",

        "abstract": "We report the results of a ∼4 yr direct imaging survey of 104 stars to resolve and characterize circumstellar debris disks in scattered light as part of the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) Exoplanet Survey. We targeted nearby (≲150 pc), young (≲500 Myr) stars with high infrared (IR) excesses (L<SUB>IR</SUB>/L<SUB>⋆</SUB> > 10<SUP>-5</SUP>), including 38 with previously resolved disks. Observations were made using the GPI high-contrast integral field spectrograph in H-band (1.6 μm) coronagraphic polarimetry mode to measure both polarized and total intensities. We resolved 26 debris disks and 3 protoplanetary/transitional disks. Seven debris disks were resolved in scattered light for the first time, including newly presented HD 117214 and HD 156623, and we quantified basic morphologies of five of them using radiative transfer models. All of our detected debris disks except HD 156623 have dust-poor inner holes, and their scattered-light radii are generally larger than corresponding radii measured from resolved thermal emission and those inferred from spectral energy distributions. To assess sensitivity, we report contrasts and consider causes of nondetections. Detections were strongly correlated with high IR excess and high inclination, although polarimetry outperformed total intensity angular differential imaging for detecting low-inclination disks (≲70°). Based on postsurvey statistics, we improved upon our presurvey target prioritization metric predicting polarimetric disk detectability. We also examined scattered-light disks in the contexts of gas, far-IR, and millimeter detections. Comparing H-band and ALMA fluxes for two disks revealed tentative evidence for differing grain properties. Finally, we found no preference for debris disks to be detected in scattered light if wide-separation substellar companions were present.",

        "abstract": "We present new H-band scattered light images of the HD 32297 edge-on debris disk obtained with the Gemini Planet Imager. The disk is detected in total and polarized intensity down to a projected angular separation of 0\"15, or 20 au. On the other hand, the large-scale swept-back halo remains undetected, likely a consequence of its markedly blue color relative to the parent body belt. We analyze the curvature of the disk spine and estimate a radius of ≍100 au for the parent body belt, smaller than past scattered light studies but consistent with thermal emission maps of the system. We employ three different flux-preserving post-processing methods to suppress the residual starlight and evaluate the surface brightness and polarization profile along the disk spine. Unlike past studies of the system, our high-fidelity images reveal the disk to be highly symmetric and devoid of morphological and surface brightness perturbations. We find the dust scattering properties of the system to be consistent with those observed in other debris disks, with the exception of HR 4796. Finally, we find no direct evidence for the presence of a planetary-mass object in the system.",

        "abstract": "The volatile contents of protoplanetary disks both set the potential for planetary chemistry and provide valuable probes of defining disk system characteristics such as stellar mass, gas mass, ionization, and temperature structure. Current disk molecular inventories are fragmented, however, giving an incomplete picture: unbiased spectral line surveys are needed to assess the volatile content. We present here an overview of such a survey of the protoplanetary disks around the Herbig Ae star MWC 480 and the T Tauri star LkCa 15 in ALMA Band 7, spanning ∼36 GHz from 275 to 317 GHz and representing an order of magnitude increase in sensitivity over previous single-dish surveys. We detect 14 molecular species (including isotopologues), with five species (C<SUP>34</SUP>S, <SUP>13</SUP>CS, H<SUB>2</SUB>CS, DNC, and C<SUB>2</SUB>D) detected for the first time in protoplanetary disks. Significant differences are observed in the molecular inventories of MWC 480 and LkCa 15, and we discuss how these results may be interpreted in light of the different physical conditions of these two disk systems.",

        "abstract": "High-contrast medium resolution spectroscopy has been used to detect molecules such as water and carbon monoxide in the atmospheres of gas giant exoplanets. In this work, we show how it can be used to derive radial velocity (RV) measurements of directly imaged exoplanets. Improving upon the traditional cross-correlation technique, we develop a new likelihood based on joint forward modeling of the planetary signal and the starlight background (i.e., speckles). After marginalizing over the starlight model, we infer the barycentric RV of HR 8799 b and c in 2010 yielding -9.2 ± 0.5 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and -11.6 ± 0.5 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. These RV measurements help to constrain the 3D orientation of the orbit of the planet by resolving the degeneracy in the longitude of an ascending node. Assuming coplanar orbits for HR 8799 b and c, but not including d and e, we estimate {{Ω }}={89^\\circ }<SUB> -17</SUB><SUP> +27</SUP> and i={20\\buildrel{\\circ}\\over{.} 8}<SUB> -3.7</SUB><SUP> +4.5</SUP>.",

        "abstract": "All four circumbinary (CB) protoplanetary disks orbiting short-period (P < 20 days) double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2s)—a group that includes UZ Tau E, for which we present new Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array data—exhibit sky-plane inclinations i <SUB>disk</SUB> that match, to within a few degrees, the sky-plane inclinations i <SUB>⋆</SUB> of their stellar hosts. Although for these systems the true mutual inclinations θ between disk and binary cannot be directly measured because relative nodal angles are unknown, the near coincidence of i <SUB>disk</SUB> and i <SUB>⋆</SUB> suggests that θ is small for these most compact of systems. We confirm this hypothesis using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis, showing that 68% of CB disks around short-period SB2s have θ < 3.°0. Near coplanarity of CB disks implies near coplanarity of CB planets discovered by Kepler, which in turn implies that the occurrence rate of close-in CB planets is similar to that around single stars. By contrast, at longer periods ranging from 30 to 10<SUP>5</SUP> days (where the nodal degeneracy can be broken via, e.g., binary astrometry), CB disks exhibit a wide range of mutual inclinations, from coplanar to polar. Many of these long-period binaries are eccentric, as their component stars are too far separated to be tidally circularized. We discuss how theories of binary formation and disk-binary gravitational interactions can accommodate all these observations.",

        "abstract": "We present a statistical analysis of the first 300 stars observed by the Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey. This subsample includes six detected planets and three brown dwarfs; from these detections and our contrast curves we infer the underlying distributions of substellar companions with respect to their mass, semimajor axis, and host stellar mass. We uncover a strong correlation between planet occurrence rate and host star mass, with stars M <SUB>*</SUB> > 1.5 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> more likely to host planets with masses between 2 and 13M <SUB>Jup</SUB> and semimajor axes of 3-100 au at 99.92% confidence. We fit a double power-law model in planet mass (m) and semimajor axis (a) for planet populations around high-mass stars (M <SUB>*</SUB> > 1.5 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) of the form {d}<SUP>2</SUP>N/({dm} {da})\\propto {m}<SUP>α </SUP> {a}<SUP>β </SUP>, finding α = -2.4 ± 0.8 and β = -2.0 ± 0.5, and an integrated occurrence rate of {9}<SUB>-4</SUB><SUP>+5</SUP>% between 5-13M <SUB>Jup</SUB> and 10-100 au. A significantly lower occurrence rate is obtained for brown dwarfs around all stars, with {0.8}<SUB>-0.5</SUB><SUP>+0.8</SUP>% of stars hosting a brown dwarf companion between 13-80M <SUB>Jup</SUB> and 10-100 au. Brown dwarfs also appear to be distributed differently in mass and semimajor axis compared to giant planets; whereas giant planets follow a bottom-heavy mass distribution and favor smaller semimajor axes, brown dwarfs exhibit just the opposite behaviors. Comparing to studies of short-period giant planets from the radial velocity method, our results are consistent with a peak in occurrence of giant planets between ∼1 and 10 au. We discuss how these trends, including the preference of giant planets for high-mass host stars, point to formation of giant planets by core/pebble accretion, and formation of brown dwarfs by gravitational instability.",

        "abstract": "Rigorously quantifying the information in high-contrast imaging data is important for informing follow-up strategies to confirm the substellar nature of a point source, constraining theoretical models of planet-disk interactions, and deriving planet occurrence rates. However, within the exoplanet direct imaging community, non-detections have almost exclusively been defined using a frequentist detection threshold (i.e., contrast curve) and associated completeness. This can lead to conceptual inconsistencies when included in a Bayesian framework. A Bayesian upper limit is such that the true value of a parameter lies below this limit with a certain probability. The associated probability is the integral of the posterior distribution with the upper limit as the upper bound. In summary, a frequentist upper limit is a statement about the detectability of planets while a Bayesian upper limit is a statement about the probability of a parameter to lie in an interval given the data. The latter is therefore better suited for rejecting hypotheses or theoretical models based on their predictions. In this work we emphasize that Bayesian statistics and upper limits are more easily interpreted and typically more constraining than the frequentist approach. We illustrate the use of Bayesian analysis in two different cases: (1) with a known planet location where we also propose to use model comparison to constrain the astrophysical nature of the point source and (2) gap-carving planets in TW Hya. To finish, we also mention the problem of combining radial velocity and direct imaging observations.",

        "abstract": "Modern radio interferometers enable observations of spectral lines with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. In spite of these technical advances, many lines of interest are still at best weakly detected and therefore necessitate detection and analysis techniques specialized for the low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) regime. Matched filters can leverage knowledge of the source structure and kinematics to increase sensitivity of spectral line observations. Application of the filter in the native Fourier domain improves S/N while simultaneously avoiding the computational cost and ambiguities associated with imaging, making matched filtering a fast and robust method for weak spectral line detection. We demonstrate how an approximate matched filter can be constructed from a previously observed line or from a model of the source, and we show how this filter can be used to robustly infer a detection significance for weak spectral lines. When applied to ALMA Cycle 2 observations of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH in the protoplanetary disk around TW Hya, the technique yields a ≈53% S/N boost over aperture-based spectral extraction methods, and we show that an even higher boost will be achieved for observations at higher spatial resolution.

        "abstract": "We present light curves and classification spectra of 17 hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) from the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1 MDS). Our sample contains all objects from the PS1 MDS sample with spectroscopic classification that are similar to either of the prototypes SN 2005ap or SN 2007bi, without an explicit limit on luminosity. With a redshift range 0.3< z< 1.6, PS1 MDS is the first SLSN sample primarily probing the high-redshift population; our multifilter PS1 light curves probe the rest-frame UV emission, and hence the peak of the spectral energy distribution. We measure the temperature evolution and construct bolometric light curves, and find peak luminosities of (0.5{--}5)× {10}<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> and lower limits on the total radiated energies of (0.3{--}2)× {10}<SUP>51</SUP> erg. The light curve shapes are diverse, with both rise and decline times spanning a factor of ∼5 and several examples of double-peaked light curves. When correcting for the flux-limited nature of our survey, we find a median peak luminosity at 4000 Å of {M}<SUB>4000</SUB>=-21.1 {mag} and a spread of σ =0.7 {mag}.",

A forward modeling of the <SUP>13</SUP>CO and C<SUP>18</SUP>O J = 2-1 transitions permits a measurement of the total stellar mass in this system, 5.29+/- 0.09 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>, and the circumtriple disk inclination, 137\\buildrel{\\circ}\\over{.} 6+/- 2\\buildrel{\\circ}\\over{.} 0. Optical spectra spanning a 35 yr period were used to derive new radial velocities and, coupled with a spectroscopic disentangling technique, revealed that the A and B components of GW Ori form a double-lined spectroscopic binary with a period of 241.50 ± 0.05 days; a tertiary companion orbits that inner pair with a period of 4218 ± 50 days. Combining the results from the ALMA data and the optical spectra with three epochs of astrometry in the literature, we constrain the individual stellar masses in the system ({M}<SUB>{{A</SUB>}}≈ 2.7 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>, {M}<SUB>{{B</SUB>}}≈ 1.7 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>, {M}<SUB>{{C</SUB>}}≈ 0.9 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>) and find strong evidence that at least one of the stellar orbital planes (and likely both) is misaligned with the disk plane by as much as 45°. A V-band light curve spanning 30 yr reveals several new ∼30-day eclipse events 0.1-0.7 mag in depth and a 0.2 mag sinusoidal oscillation that is clearly phased with the AB-C orbital period. Taken together, these features suggest that the A-B pair may be partially obscured by material in the inner disk as the pair approaches apoastron in the hierarchical orbit. Lastly, we conclude that stellar evolutionary models are consistent with our measurements of the masses and basic photospheric properties if the GW Ori system is ∼1 Myr old.",

        "abstract": "We present ALMA observations of the 2M1207 system, a young binary made of a brown dwarf with a planetary-mass companion at a projected separation of about 40 au. We detect emission from dust continuum at 0.89 mm and from the J=3-2 rotational transition of CO from a very compact disk around the young brown dwarf. The small radius found for this brown dwarf disk may be due to truncation from the tidal interaction with the planetary-mass companion. Under the assumption of optically thin dust emission, we estimate a dust mass of 0.1 M <SUB>⊕</SUB> for the 2M1207A disk and a 3σ upper limit of ∼1 M <SUB>Moon</SUB> for dust surrounding 2M1207b, which is the tightest upper limit obtained so far for the mass of dust particles surrounding a young planetary-mass companion. We discuss the impact of this and other non-detections of young planetary-mass companions for models of planet formation that predict circumplanetary material to surround these objects.",

        "abstract": "We present spectrophotometry spanning 1-5 μm of 51 Eridani b, a 2-10 {M}<SUB>{Jup</SUB>} planet discovered by the Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey. In this study, we present new K1 (1.90-2.19 μm) and K2 (2.10-2.40 μm) spectra taken with the Gemini Planet Imager as well as an updated L <SUB> P </SUB> (3.76 μm) and new M <SUB> S </SUB> (4.67 μm) photometry from the NIRC2 Narrow camera. The new data were combined with J (1.13-1.35 μm) and H (1.50-1.80 μm) spectra from the discovery epoch with the goal of better characterizing the planet properties. The 51 Eri b photometry is redder than field brown dwarfs as well as known young T-dwarfs with similar spectral type (between T4 and T8), and we propose that 51 Eri b might be in the process of undergoing the transition from L-type to T-type. We used two complementary atmosphere model grids including either deep iron/silicate clouds or sulfide/salt clouds in the photosphere, spanning a range of cloud properties, including fully cloudy, cloud-free, and patchy/intermediate-opacity clouds. The model fits suggest that 51 Eri b has an effective temperature ranging between 605 and 737 K, a solar metallicity, and a surface gravity of log(g) = 3.5-4.0 dex, and the atmosphere requires a patchy cloud atmosphere to model the spectral energy distribution (SED). From the model atmospheres, we infer a luminosity for the planet of -5.83 to -5.93 ({log}L/{L}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>), leaving 51 Eri b in the unique position of being one of the only directly imaged planets consistent with having formed via a cold-start scenario. Comparisons of the planet SED against warm-start models indicate that the planet luminosity is best reproduced by a planet formed via core accretion with a core mass between 15 and 127 {M}<SUB>\\oplus </SUB>.",

        "abstract": "We present a new matched-filter algorithm for direct detection of point sources in the immediate vicinity of bright stars. The stellar point-spread function (PSF) is first subtracted using a Karhunen-Loéve image processing (KLIP) algorithm with angular and spectral differential imaging (ADI and SDI). The KLIP-induced distortion of the astrophysical signal is included in the matched-filter template by computing a forward model of the PSF at every position in the image. To optimize the performance of the algorithm, we conduct extensive planet injection and recovery tests and tune the exoplanet spectra template and KLIP reduction aggressiveness to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the recovered planets. We show that only two spectral templates are necessary to recover any young Jovian exoplanets with minimal S/N loss. We also developed a complete pipeline for the automated detection of point-source candidates, the calculation of receiver operating characteristics (ROC), contrast curves based on false positives, and completeness contours. We process in a uniform manner more than 330 data sets from the Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey and assess GPI typical sensitivity as a function of the star and the hypothetical companion spectral type. This work allows for the first time a comparison of different detection algorithms at a survey scale accounting for both planet completeness and false-positive rate. We show that the new forward model matched filter allows the detection of 50% fainter objects than a conventional cross-correlation technique with a Gaussian PSF template for the same false-positive rate.",

        "abstract": "Measurements of radial velocity variations from the spectroscopic monitoring of stars and their companions are essential for a broad swath of astrophysics; these measurements provide access to the fundamental physical properties that dictate all phases of stellar evolution and facilitate the quantitative study of planetary systems. The conversion of those measurements into both constraints on the orbital architecture and individual component spectra can be a serious challenge, however, especially for extreme flux ratio systems and observations with relatively low sensitivity. Gaussian processes define sampling distributions of flexible, continuous functions that are well-motivated for modeling stellar spectra, enabling proficient searches for companion lines in time-series spectra. We introduce a new technique for spectral disentangling, where the posterior distributions of the orbital parameters and intrinsic, rest-frame stellar spectra are explored simultaneously without needing to invoke cross-correlation templates. To demonstrate its potential, this technique is deployed on red-optical time-series spectra of the mid-M-dwarf binary LP661-13. We report orbital parameters with improved precision compared to traditional radial velocity analysis and successfully reconstruct the primary and secondary spectra. We discuss potential applications for other stellar and exoplanet radial velocity techniques and extensions to time-variable spectra. The code used in this analysis is freely available as an open-source Python package.",

        "abstract": "Ages and masses of young stars are often estimated by comparing their luminosities and effective temperatures to pre-main-sequence stellar evolution tracks, but magnetic fields and starspots complicate both the observations and evolution. To understand their influence, we study the heavily spotted weak-lined T-Tauri star LkCa 4 by searching for spectral signatures of radiation originating from the starspot or starspot groups. We introduce a new methodology for constraining both the starspot filling factor and the spot temperature by fitting two-temperature stellar atmosphere models constructed from Phoenix synthetic spectra to a high-resolution near-IR IGRINS spectrum. Clearly discernable spectral features arise from both a hot photospheric component {T}<SUB>{hot</SUB>} ∼ 4100 K and a cool component {T}<SUB>{cool</SUB>} ∼ 2700-3000 K, which covers ∼80% of the visible surface. This mix of hot and cool emission is supported by analyses of the spectral energy distribution, rotational modulation of colors and of TiO band strengths, and features in low-resolution optical/near-IR spectroscopy. Although the revised effective temperature and luminosity make LkCa 4 appear to be much younger and of much lower mass than previous estimates from unspotted stellar evolution models, appropriate estimates will require the production and adoption of spotted evolutionary models. Biases from starspots likely afflict most fully convective young stars and contribute to uncertainties in ages and age spreads of open clusters. In some spectral regions, starspots act as a featureless “veiling” continuum owing to high rotational broadening and heavy line blanketing in cool star spectra. Some evidence is also found for an anticorrelation between the velocities of the warm and cool components.",

        "abstract": "We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the GQ Lup system, a young Sun-like star with a substellar-mass companion in a wide-separation orbit. These observations of 870 μm continuum and CO J = 3-2 line emission with beam size ∼0.″3 (∼45 au) resolve the disk of dust and gas surrounding the primary star, GQ Lup A, and provide deep limits on any circumplanetary disk surrounding the companion, GQ Lup b. The circumprimary dust disk is compact with an FWHM of 59 ± 12 au, while the gas has a larger extent with a characteristic radius of 46.5 ± 1.8 au. By forward-modeling the velocity field of the circumprimary disk based on the CO emission, we constrain the mass of GQ Lup A to be M<SUB>*</SUB> = (1.03 ± 0.05) ∗ (d/156 pc) M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, where d is a known distance, and determine that we view the disk at an inclination angle of 60.°5 ± 0.°5 and a position angle of 346° ± 1°. The 3σ upper limit on the 870 μm flux density of any circumplanetary disk associated with GQ Lup b of <0.15 mJy implies an upper limit on the dust disk mass of <0.04 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> for standard assumptions about optically thin emission. We discuss proposed mechanisms for the formation of wide-separation substellar companions given the non-detection of circumplanetary disks around GQ Lup b and other similar systems.",

        "abstract": "The spatial distribution of gas and solids in protoplanetary disks determines the composition and formation efficiency of planetary systems. A number of disks show starkly different distributions for the gas and small grains compared to millimeter-centimeter-sized dust. We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array observations of the dust continuum, CO, <SUP>13</SUP>CO, and C<SUP>18</SUP>O in the IM Lup protoplanetary disk, one of the first systems where this dust-gas dichotomy was clearly seen. The <SUP>12</SUP>CO is detected out to a radius of 970 au, while the millimeter continuum emission is truncated at just 313 au. Based upon these data, we have built a comprehensive physical and chemical model for the disk structure, which takes into account the complex, coupled nature of the gas and dust and the interplay between the local and external environment. We constrain the distributions of gas and dust, the gas temperatures, the CO abundances, the CO optical depths, and the incident external radiation field. We find that the reduction/removal of dust from the outer disk exposes this region to higher stellar and external radiation and decreases the rate of freeze-out, allowing CO to remain in the gas out to large radial distances. We estimate a gas-phase CO abundance of 5% of the interstellar medium value and a low external radiation field (G <SUB>0</SUB> ≲ 4). The latter is consistent with that expected from the local stellar population. We additionally find tentative evidence for ring-like continuum substructure, suggestions of isotope-selective photodissociation, and a diffuse gas halo.",

        "abstract": "We present optical spectroscopy, ultraviolet-to-infrared imaging, and X-ray observations of the intermediate luminosity optical transient (ILOT) SN 2010da in NGC 300 (d = 1.86 Mpc) spanning from -6 to +6 years relative to the time of outburst in 2010. Based on the light-curve and multi-epoch spectral energy distributions of SN 2010da, we conclude that the progenitor of SN 2010da is a ≈10-12 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yellow supergiant possibly transitioning into a blue-loop phase. During outburst, SN 2010da had a peak absolute magnitude of M <SUB>bol</SUB> ≲ -10.4 mag, dimmer than other ILOTs and supernova impostors. We detect multi-component hydrogen Balmer, Paschen, and Ca II emission lines in our high-resolution spectra, which indicate a dusty and complex circumstellar environment. Since the 2010 eruption, the star has brightened by a factor of ≈5 and remains highly variable in the optical. Furthermore, we detect SN 2010da in archival Swift and Chandra observations as an ultraluminous X-ray source (L <SUB>X</SUB> ≈ 6 × 10<SUP>39</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>). We additionally attribute He II 4686 Å and coronal Fe emission lines in addition to a steady X-ray luminosity of ≈10<SUP>37</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> to the presence of a compact companion.",

        "abstract": "We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of CO J = 2-1 line emission from the DQ Tau circumbinary disk. These data are used to tomographically reconstruct the Keplerian disk velocity field in a forward-modeling inference framework, and thereby provide a dynamical constraint on the mass of the DQ Tau binary of {M}<SUB>*</SUB>={1.27}<SUB>-0.27</SUB><SUP>+0.46</SUP> {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>. Those results are compared with an updated and improved orbital solution for this double-lined system based on long-term monitoring of its stellar radial velocities. Both of these independent dynamical constraints on the binary mass are in excellent agreement: taken together, they demonstrate that the DQ Tau system mass is 1.21 ± 0.26 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and that the disk and binary orbital planes are aligned within 3° (at 3σ confidence). The predictions of various theoretical models for pre-main-sequence stellar evolution are also consistent with these masses, though more detailed comparisons are difficult due to lingering uncertainties regarding the photospheric properties of the individual components. DQ Tau is the third, nearly equal-mass, double-lined spectroscopic binary with a circumbinary disk that has been dynamically “weighed” with these two independent techniques: all show consistent results, validating the overall accuracy of the disk-based approach and demonstrating that it can be robustly applied to large samples of young, single stars as ALMA ramps up to operations at full capacity.",

        "abstract": "We present a modular, extensible likelihood framework for spectroscopic inference based on synthetic model spectra. The subtraction of an imperfect model from a continuously sampled spectrum introduces covariance between adjacent datapoints (pixels) into the residual spectrum. For the high signal-to-noise data with large spectral range that is commonly employed in stellar astrophysics, that covariant structure can lead to dramatically underestimated parameter uncertainties (and, in some cases, biases). We construct a likelihood function that accounts for the structure of the covariance matrix, utilizing the machinery of Gaussian process kernels. This framework specifically addresses the common problem of mismatches in model spectral line strengths (with respect to data) due to intrinsic model imperfections (e.g., in the atomic/molecular databases or opacity prescriptions) by developing a novel local covariance kernel formalism that identifies and self-consistently downweights pathological spectral line “outliers.” By fitting many spectra in a hierarchical manner, these local kernels provide a mechanism to learn about and build data-driven corrections to synthetic spectral libraries. An open-source software implementation of this approach is available at <A href=\"http://iancze.github.io/Starfish\">http://iancze.github.io/Starfish</A>, including a sophisticated probabilistic scheme for spectral interpolation when using model libraries that are sparsely sampled in the stellar parameters. We demonstrate some salient features of the framework by fitting the high-resolution V-band spectrum of WASP-14, an F5 dwarf with a transiting exoplanet, and the moderate-resolution K-band spectrum of Gliese 51, an M5 field dwarf.",

        "abstract": "We present spatially and spectrally resolved Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of gas and dust in the disk orbiting the pre-main sequence (pre-MS) binary AK Sco. By forward-modeling the disk velocity field traced by CO J = 2-1 line emission, we infer the mass of the central binary, {M}<SUB>*</SUB>=2.49+/- 0.10 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>, a new dynamical measurement that is independent of stellar evolutionary models. Assuming the disk and binary are co-planar within ∼2°, this disk-based binary mass measurement is in excellent agreement with constraints from radial velocity monitoring of the combined stellar spectra. These ALMA results are also compared with the standard approach of estimating masses from the location of the binary in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, using several common pre-MS model grids. These models predict stellar masses that are marginally consistent with our dynamical measurement (at ∼2σ), but are systematically high (by ∼10%). These same models consistently predict an age of 18 ± 1 Myr for AK Sco, in line with its membership in the Upper Centaurus-Lupus association but surprisingly old for it to still host a gas-rich disk. As ALMA accumulates comparable data for large samples of pre-MS stars, the methodology employed here to extract a dynamical mass from the disk rotation curve should prove extraordinarily useful for efforts to characterize the fundamental parameters of early stellar evolution.",

        "abstract": "Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based observations of the Type IIn supernova (SN) 2010jl are analyzed, including photometry and spectroscopy in the ultraviolet, optical, and near-IR bands, 26-1128 days after first detection. At maximum, the bolometric luminosity was ~3 × 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> and even at 850 days exceeds 10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. A near-IR excess, dominating after 400 days, probably originates in dust in the circumstellar medium (CSM). The total radiated energy is >~ 6.5 × 10<SUP>50</SUP> erg, excluding the dust component. The spectral lines can be separated into one broad component that is due to electron scattering and one narrow with expansion velocity ~100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> from the CSM. The broad component is initially symmetric around zero velocity but becomes blueshifted after ~50 days, while remaining symmetric about a shifted centroid velocity. Dust absorption in the ejecta is unlikely to explain the line shifts, and we attribute the shift instead to acceleration by the SN radiation. From the optical lines and the X-ray and dust properties, there is strong evidence for large-scale asymmetries in the CSM. The ultraviolet lines indicate CNO processing in the progenitor, while the optical shows a number of narrow coronal lines excited by the X-rays. The bolometric light curve is consistent with a radiative shock in an r <SUP>-2</SUP> CSM with a mass-loss rate of \\dot{M}∼ 0.1 M_⊙ yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The total mass lost is >~ 3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. These properties are consistent with the SN expanding into a CSM characteristic of a luminous blue variable progenitor with a bipolar geometry. The apparent absence of nuclear processing is attributed to a CSM that is still opaque to electron scattering.",

        "abstract": "We probe the systematic uncertainties from the 113 Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) in the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) sample along with 197 SN Ia from a combination of low-redshift surveys. The companion paper by Rest et al. describes the photometric measurements and cosmological inferences from the PS1 sample. The largest systematic uncertainty stems from the photometric calibration of the PS1 and low-z samples. We increase the sample of observed Calspec standards from 7 to 10 used to define the PS1 calibration system. The PS1 and SDSS-II calibration systems are compared and discrepancies up to ~0.02 mag are recovered. We find uncertainties in the proper way to treat intrinsic colors and reddening produce differences in the recovered value of w up to 3%. We estimate masses of host galaxies of PS1 supernovae and detect an insignificant difference in distance residuals of the full sample of 0.037 ± 0.031 mag for host galaxies with high and low masses. Assuming flatness and including systematic uncertainties in our analysis of only SNe measurements, we find w =-1.120<SUP>+0.360</SUP><SUB>-0.206</SUB>(Stat) <SUP>+0.269</SUP><SUB>-0.291</SUB>(Sys). With additional constraints from Baryon acoustic oscillation, cosmic microwave background (CMB) (Planck) and H <SUB>0</SUB> measurements, we find w=-1.166<SUP>+0.072</SUP><SUB>-0.069</SUB> and Ω _m=0.280<SUP>+0.013</SUP><SUB>-0.012</SUB> (statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature). The significance of the inconsistency with w = -1 depends on whether we use Planck or Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe measurements of the CMB: w<SUB>BAO+H0+SN+{WMAP</SUB>}=-1.124<SUP>+0.083</SUP><SUB>-0.065</SUB>.",

        "abstract": "We present griz <SUB>P1</SUB> light curves of 146 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia 0.03 < z < 0.65) discovered during the first 1.5 yr of the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey. The Pan-STARRS1 natural photometric system is determined by a combination of on-site measurements of the instrument response function and observations of spectrophotometric standard stars. We find that the systematic uncertainties in the photometric system are currently 1.2% without accounting for the uncertainty in the Hubble Space Telescope Calspec definition of the AB system. A Hubble diagram is constructed with a subset of 113 out of 146 SNe Ia that pass our light curve quality cuts. The cosmological fit to 310 SNe Ia (113 PS1 SNe Ia + 222 light curves from 197 low-z SNe Ia), using only supernovae (SNe) and assuming a constant dark energy equation of state and flatness, yields w=-1.120<SUP>+0.360</SUP><SUB>-0.206</SUB>{(Stat)} <SUP>+0.269</SUP><SUB>-0.291</SUB>{(Sys)}. When combined with BAO+CMB(Planck)+H <SUB>0</SUB>, the analysis yields Ω _M=0.280<SUP>+0.013</SUP><SUB>-0.012</SUB> and w=-1.166<SUP>+0.072</SUP><SUB>-0.069</SUB> including all identified systematics. The value of w is inconsistent with the cosmological constant value of -1 at the 2.3σ level. Tension endures after removing either the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) or the H <SUB>0</SUB> constraint, though it is strongest when including the H <SUB>0</SUB> constraint. If we include WMAP9 cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraints instead of those from Planck, we find w=-1.124<SUP>+0.083</SUP><SUB>-0.065</SUB>, which diminishes the discord to <2σ. We cannot conclude whether the tension with flat ΛCDM is a feature of dark energy, new physics, or a combination of chance and systematic errors. The full Pan-STARRS1 SN sample with ~three times as many SNe should provide more conclusive results.",

        "abstract": "We present optical photometric and spectroscopic coverage of the superluminous supernova (SLSN) PS1-11ap, discovered with the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey at z = 0.524. This intrinsically blue transient rose slowly to reach a peak magnitude of M<SUB>u</SUB> = -21.4 mag and bolometric luminosity of 8 × 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> before settling on to a relatively shallow gradient of decline. The observed decline is significantly slower than those of the SLSNe-Ic which have been the focus of much recent attention. Spectroscopic similarities with the lower redshift SN2007bi and a decline rate similar to <SUP>56</SUP>Co decay time-scale initially indicated that this transient could be a candidate for a pair instability supernova (PISN) explosion. Overall the transient appears quite similar to SN2007bi and the lower redshift object PTF12dam. The extensive data set, from 30 d before peak to 230 d after, allows a detailed and quantitative comparison with published models of PISN explosions. We find that the PS1-11ap data do not match these model explosion parameters well, supporting the recent claim that these SNe are not pair instability explosions. We show that PS1-11ap has many features in common with the faster declining SLSNe-Ic, and the light-curve evolution can also be quantitatively explained by the magnetar spin-down model. At a redshift of z = 0.524, the observer-frame optical coverage provides comprehensive rest-frame UV data and allows us to compare it with the SLSNe recently found at high redshifts between z = 2 and 4. While these high-z explosions are still plausible PISN candidates, they match the photometric evolution of PS1-11ap and hence could be counterparts to this lower redshift transient.",

        "abstract": "We present the Pan-STARRS1 discovery of the long-lived and blue transient PS1-11af, which was also detected by Galaxy Evolution Explorer with coordinated observations in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) band. PS1-11af is associated with the nucleus of an early type galaxy at redshift z = 0.4046 that exhibits no evidence for star formation or active galactic nucleus activity. Four epochs of spectroscopy reveal a pair of transient broad absorption features in the UV on otherwise featureless spectra. Despite the superficial similarity of these features to P-Cygni absorptions of supernovae (SNe), we conclude that PS1-11af is not consistent with the properties of known types of SNe. Blackbody fits to the spectral energy distribution are inconsistent with the cooling, expanding ejecta of a SN, and the velocities of the absorption features are too high to represent material in homologous expansion near a SN photosphere. However, the constant blue colors and slow evolution of the luminosity are similar to previous optically selected tidal disruption events (TDEs). The shape of the optical light curve is consistent with models for TDEs, but the minimum accreted mass necessary to power the observed luminosity is only ~0.002 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, which points to a partial disruption model. A full disruption model predicts higher bolometric luminosities, which would require most of the radiation to be emitted in a separate component at high energies where we lack observations. In addition, the observed temperature is lower than that predicted by pure accretion disk models for TDEs and requires reprocessing to a constant, lower temperature. Three deep non-detections in the radio with the Very Large Array over the first two years after the event set strict limits on the production of any relativistic outflow comparable to Swift J1644+57, even if off-axis.",

        "abstract": "We present observations and analysis of PS1-10bzj, a superluminous supernova (SLSN) discovered in the Pan-STARRS Medium Deep Survey at a redshift z = 0.650. Spectroscopically, PS1-10bzj is similar to the hydrogen-poor SLSNe 2005ap and SCP 06F6, though with a steeper rise and lower peak luminosity (M <SUB>bol</SUB> ~= -21.4 mag) than previous events. We construct a bolometric light curve, and show that while PS1-10bzj's energetics were less extreme than previous events, its luminosity still cannot be explained by radioactive nickel decay alone. We explore both a magnetar spin-down and circumstellar interaction scenario and find that either can fit the data. PS1-10bzj is located in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South and the host galaxy is imaged in a number of surveys, including with the Hubble Space Telescope. The host is a compact dwarf galaxy (M<SUB>B</SUB> ≈ -18 mag, diameter <~ 800 pc), with a low stellar mass (M <SUB>*</SUB> ≈ 2.4 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>), young stellar population (τ<SUB>*</SUB> ≈ 5 Myr), and a star formation rate of ~2-3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The specific star formation rate is the highest seen in an SLSN host so far (~100 Gyr<SUP>-1</SUP>). We detect the [O III] λ4363 line, and find a low metallicity: 12 + (O/H) = 7.8 ± 0.2 (sime 0.1 Z <SUB>⊙</SUB>). Together, this indicates that at least some of the progenitors of SLSNe come from young, low-metallicity populations.",

        "abstract": "We present observations of the afterglows and host galaxies of three short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs): 100625A, 101219A, and 110112A. We find that GRB 100625A occurred in a z = 0.452 early-type galaxy with a stellar mass of ≈4.6 × 10<SUP>9</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> and a stellar population age of ≈0.7 Gyr, and GRB 101219A originated in a star-forming galaxy at z = 0.718 with a stellar mass of ≈1.4 × 10<SUP>9</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, a star formation rate of ≈16 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, and a stellar population age of ≈50 Myr. We also report the discovery of the optical afterglow of GRB 110112A, which lacks a coincident host galaxy to i >~ 26 mag, and we cannot conclusively identify any field galaxy as a possible host. From afterglow modeling, the bursts have inferred circumburst densities of ≈10<SUP>-4</SUP>-1 cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray and kinetic energies of ≈10<SUP>50</SUP>-10<SUP>51</SUP> erg. These three events highlight the diversity of galactic environments that host short GRBs. To quantify this diversity, we use the sample of 36 Swift short GRBs with robust associations to an environment (~1/2 of 68 short bursts detected by Swift to 2012 May) and classify bursts originating from four types of environments: late-type (≈50%), early-type (≈15%), inconclusive (≈20%), and \"host-less\" (lacking a coincident host galaxy to limits of >~ 26 mag ≈15%). To find likely ranges for the true late- and early-type fractions, we assign each of the host-less bursts to either the late- or early-type category using probabilistic arguments and consider the scenario that all hosts in the inconclusive category are early-type galaxies to set an upper bound on the early-type fraction. We calculate most likely ranges for the late- and early-type fractions of ≈60%-80% and ≈20%-40%, respectively. We find no clear trend between gamma-ray duration and host type. We also find no change to the fractions when excluding events recently claimed as possible contaminants from the long GRB/collapsar population. Our reported demographics are consistent with a short GRB rate driven by both stellar mass and star formation.",

        "abstract": "We present the Pan-STARRS1 discovery of PS1-10afx, a unique hydrogen-deficient superluminous supernova (SLSN) at redshift z = 1.388. The light curve peaked at z <SUB>P1</SUB> = 21.7 mag, making PS1-10afx comparable to the most luminous known SNe, with M<SUB>u</SUB> = -22.3 mag. Our extensive optical and near-infrared observations indicate that the bolometric light curve of PS1-10afx rose on the unusually fast timescale of ~12 days to the extraordinary peak luminosity of 4.1 × 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> (M <SUB>bol</SUB> = -22.8 mag) and subsequently faded rapidly. Equally important, the spectral energy distribution is unusually red for an SLSN, with a color temperature of ~6800 K near maximum light, in contrast to previous hydrogen-poor SLSNe, which are bright in the ultraviolet (UV). The spectra more closely resemble those of a normal SN Ic than any known SLSN, with a photospheric velocity of ~11, 000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and evidence for line blanketing in the rest-frame UV. Despite the fast rise, these parameters imply a very large emitting radius (gsim 5 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> cm). We demonstrate that no existing theoretical model can satisfactorily explain this combination of properties: (1) a nickel-powered light curve cannot match the combination of high peak luminosity with the fast timescale; (2) models powered by the spindown energy of a rapidly rotating magnetar predict significantly hotter and faster ejecta; and (3) models invoking shock breakout through a dense circumstellar medium cannot explain the observed spectra or color evolution. The host galaxy is well detected in pre-explosion imaging with a luminosity near L*, a star formation rate of ~15 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, and is fairly massive (~2 × 10<SUP>10</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>), with a stellar population age of ~10<SUP>8</SUP> yr, also in contrast to the young dwarf hosts of known hydrogen-poor SLSNe. PS1-10afx is distinct from known examples of SLSNe in its spectra, colors, light-curve shape, and host galaxy properties, suggesting that it resulted from a different channel than other hydrogen-poor SLSNe.",

Our multi-band light curve traces the fast decline (t <SUB>2</SUB> = 3.5 ± 0.3 days) from maximum light (M<SUB>V</SUB> = -10.2 ± 0.1 mag), placing SN 2010U in the top 0.5% of the most luminous novae ever observed. We find typical ejecta velocities of ≈1100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and that SN 2010U shares many spectral and photometric characteristics with two other fast and luminous Fe II type novae, including Nova LMC 1991 and M31N-2007-11d. For the extreme luminosity of this nova, the maximum magnitude versus rate of decline relationship indicates a massive white dwarf (WD) progenitor with a low pre-outburst accretion rate. However, this prediction is in conflict with emerging theories of nova populations, which predict that luminous novae from massive WDs should preferentially exhibit an alternate spectral type (He/N) near maximum light.",

        "abstract": "We present the first spectroscopic study of the host environments of Type Ibc supernovae (SNe Ibc) discovered exclusively by untargeted SN searches. Past studies of SN Ibc host environments have been biased toward high-mass, high-metallicity galaxies by focusing on SNe discovered in galaxy-targeted SN searches. Our new observations more than double the total number of spectroscopic stellar population age and metallicity measurements published for untargeted SN Ibc host environments. For the 12 SNe Ib and 21 SNe Ic in our metallicity sample, we find median metallicities of 0.62 Z <SUB>⊙</SUB> and 0.83 Z <SUB>⊙</SUB>, respectively, but determine that the discrepancy in the full distribution of metallicities is not statistically significant. This median difference would correspond to only a small difference in the mass loss via metal-line-driven winds (lsim 30%), suggesting this does not play the dominant role in distinguishing SNe Ib and Ic progenitors. However, the median metallicity of the seven broad-lined SNe Ic (SNe Ic-BL) in our sample is significantly lower, 0.45 Z <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The age of the young stellar population of SN Ic-BL host environments also seems to be lower than for SNe Ib and Ic, but our age sample is small. Combining all SN Ibc host environment spectroscopy from the literature to date does not reveal a significant difference in SN Ib and Ic metallicities, but reinforces the significance of the lower metallicities for SNe Ic-BL. This combined sample demonstrates that galaxy-targeted SN searches introduce a significant bias for studies seeking to infer the metallicity distribution of SN progenitors, and we identify and discuss other systematic effects that play smaller roles. We discuss the path forward for making progress on SN Ibc progenitor studies in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope era. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.",

        "abstract": "We present broadband observations of the afterglow and environment of the short GRB 111020A. An extensive X-ray light curve from Swift/XRT, XMM-Newton, and Chandra, spanning ~100 s to 10 days after the burst, reveals a significant break at δt ≈ 2 days with pre- and post-break decline rates of α<SUB> X, 1</SUB> ≈ -0.78 and α<SUB> X, 2</SUB> <~ -1.7, respectively. Interpreted as a jet break, we infer a collimated outflow with an opening angle of θ<SUB> j </SUB> ≈ 3°-8°. The resulting beaming-corrected γ-ray (10-1000 keV band) and blast-wave kinetic energies are (2-3) × 10<SUP>48</SUP> erg and (0.3-2) × 10<SUP>49</SUP> erg, respectively, with the range depending on the unknown redshift of the burst. We report a radio afterglow limit of <39 μJy (3σ) from Expanded Very Large Array observations that, along with our finding that ν<SUB> c </SUB> < ν<SUB> X </SUB>, constrains the circumburst density to n <SUB>0</SUB> ~ 0.01-0.1 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. Optical observations provide an afterglow limit of i >~ 24.4 mag at 18 hr after the burst and reveal a potential host galaxy with i ≈ 24.3 mag. The subarcsecond localization from Chandra provides a precise offset of 0farcs80 ± 0farcs11 (1σ) from this galaxy corresponding to an offset of 5-7 kpc for z = 0.5-1.5. We find a high excess neutral hydrogen column density of (7.5 ± 2.0) × 10<SUP>21</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> (z = 0). Our observations demonstrate that a growing fraction of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are collimated, which may lead to a true event rate of >~ 100-1000 Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, in good agreement with the NS-NS merger rate of ≈200-3000 Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. This consistency is promising for coincident short GRB-gravitational wave searches in the forthcoming era of Advanced LIGO/VIRGO.",

        "abstract": "We present the Pan-STARRS1 discovery and light curves, and follow-up MMT and Gemini spectroscopy of an ultraluminous supernova (ULSN; dubbed PS1-11bam) at a redshift of z = 1.566 with a peak brightness of M <SUB>UV</SUB> ≈ -22.3 mag. PS1-11bam is one of the highest redshift spectroscopically confirmed SNe known to date. The spectrum exhibits broad absorption features typical of previous ULSNe (e.g., C II, Si III), and strong and narrow Mg II and Fe II absorption lines from the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy, confirmed by an [O II]λ3727 emission line at the same redshift. The equivalent widths of the Fe II λ2600 and Mg II λ2803 lines are in the top quartile of the quasar intervening absorption system distribution, but are weaker than those of gamma-ray burst intrinsic absorbers (i.e., GRB host galaxies). We also detect the host galaxy in pre-explosion Pan-STARRS1 data and find that its UV spectral energy distribution is best fit with a young stellar population age of τ<SUB>*</SUB> ≈ 15-45 Myr and a stellar mass of M <SUB>*</SUB> ≈ (1.1-2.6) × 10<SUP>9</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> (for Z = 0.05-1 Z <SUB>⊙</SUB>). The star formation rate inferred from the UV continuum and [O II]λ3727 emission line is ≈10 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, higher than in previous ULSN hosts. PS1-11bam provides the first direct demonstration that ULSNe can serve as probes of the ISM in distant galaxies. The depth and red sensitivity of PS1 are uniquely suited to finding such events at cosmologically interesting redshifts (z ~ 1-2); the future combination of LSST and 30 m class telescopes promises to extend this technique to z ~ 4.",

        "abstract": "We present the discovery of two ultraluminous supernovae (SNe) at z ≈ 0.9 with the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey. These SNe, PS1-10ky and PS1-10awh, are among the most luminous SNe ever discovered, comparable to the unusual transients SN 2005ap and SCP 06F6. Like SN 2005ap and SCP 06F6, they show characteristic high luminosities (M <SUB>bol</SUB> ≈ -22.5 mag), blue spectra with a few broad absorption lines, and no evidence for H or He. We have constructed a full multi-color light curve sensitive to the peak of the spectral energy distribution in the rest-frame ultraviolet, and we have obtained time series spectroscopy for these SNe. Given the similarities between the SNe, we combine their light curves to estimate a total radiated energy over the course of explosion of (0.9-1.4) × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg. We find photospheric velocities of 12,000-19,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> with no evidence for deceleration measured across ~3 rest-frame weeks around light curve peak, consistent with the expansion of an optically thick massive shell of material. We show that, consistent with findings for other ultraluminous SNe in this class, radioactive decay is not sufficient to power PS1-10ky, and we discuss two plausible origins for these events: the initial spin-down of a newborn magnetar in a core-collapse SN, or SN shock breakout from the dense circumstellar wind surrounding a Wolf-Rayet star.",

        "abstract": "We present high angular resolution (down to 0farcs3 ≈ 13 AU in diameter) Submillimeter Array observations of the 880 μm (340 GHz) thermal continuum emission from circumstellar dust disks in the nearby HD 98800 and Hen 3-600 multiple star systems. In both cases, the dust emission is resolved and localized around one stellar component—the HD 98800B and Hen 3-600A spectroscopic binaries—with no evidence for circum-system material. Using two-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations, we compare the Submillimeter Array interferometer visibilities and broadband spectral energy distributions with truncated disk models to empirically locate the inner and outer edges of both disks. The HD 98800B disk appears to be aligned with the spectroscopic binary orbit, is internally truncated at a radius of 3.5 AU, and extends to only 10-15 AU from the central stars. The Hen 3-600A disk is slightly larger, with an inner edge at ~1 AU and an outer radius of 15-25 AU. These inferred disk structures compare favorably with theoretical predictions of their truncation due to tidal interactions with the stellar companions.",
