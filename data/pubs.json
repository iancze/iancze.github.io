        "abstract": "We present a spectroscopic analysis of the GM Aur disk using JWST MIRI-MRS, as part of the JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS). The 1D spectrum exhibits faint dust continuum emission and is relatively poor in molecular gas compared to protoplanetary disks with no inner dust cavities. We identify fundamental CO emission, bright rotationally excited OH lines longward of 9 μm, weak rotational H<SUB>2</SUB>O emission, the methyl cation CH3+, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, and tentatively identify CO<SUB>2</SUB>. Otherwise, the spectrum is dominated by H<SUB>2</SUB> and atomic emission. We model the molecular spectra using slab models and retrieve excitation temperatures, column densities, and emitting areas in a Bayesian framework. The OH line fluxes are used to estimate the photodissociation rate of water. We find that 5.4 × 10<SUP>40</SUP> H<SUB>2</SUB>O molecules are photodestroyed every second, which suggests that the highest-energy OH lines trace a region near the 0.2 au dust cavity wall with an incident far-ultraviolet flux of G<SUB>0</SUB> ∼ 10<SUP>7</SUP>. The OH emission is compared to DALI models, which point toward a high incident flux of Lyα photons in the OH emitting region. We further use the H I lines to provide an independent estimate of the accretion luminosity and mass accretion rate, in agreement with prior measurements. A comparison with other cavity disks indicates that more evolved systems such as GM Aur may be less volatile rich and are characterized by brighter OH prompt emission and abundant molecular ions.",

        "abstract": "The exoALMA program gave an unprecedented view of the complex kinematics of protoplanetary disks, revealing diverse structures that remain poorly understood. We show that moderate disk warps (∼0.°5–2°) can naturally explain many of the observed large-scale velocity features with azimuthal wavenumber m = 1. Using a simple model, we interpret line-of-sight velocity variations as changes in the projected Keplerian rotation caused by warping of the disk. While not a unique explanation, this interpretation aligns with growing observational evidence that warps are common. We demonstrate that such warps can also produce spiral structures in scattered light and CO brightness temperature, with ∼10 K variations in MWC 758. Within the exoALMA sample, warp properties correlate with stellar accretion rates, suggesting a link between the inner disk and outer disk kinematics. If warps cause large-scale kinematic structure, this has far-reaching implications for turbulence, angular momentum transport, and planet formation.",

        "abstract": "We present new observations of the PDS 70 disc obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimetre Array (ALMA) in Band 9 (671 GHz) at 0.242 arcsec resolution, which provide valuable insights into the spatial distribution of submillimetre grains in the disc. The data reveal a ring-like morphology, with a radial peak located between those previously observed at infrared wavelengths and longer millimetre observations. Additionally, we detect a tentative outer shoulder in Band 9 that is not observed at longer wavelengths. These findings suggest that small grains (m) traced by Band 9 may be escaping from the pressure bump both radially inwards and outwards, or may be tracing different disc layers than those probed at longer wavelengths. A multiwavelength analysis of the disc at millimetre wavelengths and the best fit to the spectral energy distribution shows the presence of centimetre grains around the ring location, where the dust surface density also peaks, compatible with dust trap models. The grain size in the disc cavity is not well constrained but is consistent with grains as small as 10 m, supporting the hypothesis that small dust grain filters through the cavity. We use dust evolution models to demonstrate that a turbulent viscosity of  allows small grains to filter through the disc gap, while  is required to retain large grains in the pressure bump. The Band 9 observations of PDS 70 validate theoretical models and confirm the presence of pebble flux through the disc gap.",

In the former, the SO emission comes in the shape of a ring, arises from the edge of the continuum cavity, and is qualitatively consistent, at the currently available spectral resolution, with being in Keplerian rotation. In the latter, instead, while arising primarily from inside the continuum cavity, the SO emission also extends to the continuum ring(s), and its morphology and kinematics are less clear. We put these sources in the context of the other protoplanetary disks where SO detections have been previously reported in the literature and discuss the possible origins of SO in terms of (thermal) desorption or formation in the gas-phase. We argue that these processes might be fostered by dynamical perturbations caused by unseen embedded massive companions, shadows, or late-time infall, thus suggesting a possible link between perturbed dynamics and SO emission in (these) protoplanetary disks. If confirmed, our interpretation would imply that chemical evolution timescales could be significantly shorter in these systems than is commonly assumed, indicating that dynamical perturbations might influence the composition of newborn (proto)planets by altering the volatile makeup of their formation environment.",

        "abstract": "The key planet-formation processes in protoplanetary disks remain an active matter of research. One promising mechanism to radially and azimuthally trap millimeter-emitting dust grains, enabling them to concentrate and grow into planetesimals, is anticyclonic vortices. While dust observations have revealed crescent structures in several disks, observations of their kinematic signatures are still lacking. Studying the gas dynamics is, however, essential to confirm the presence of a vortex and understand its dust trapping properties. In this work, we make use of the high-resolution and sensitivity observations conducted by the exoALMA large program to search for such signatures in the <SUP>12</SUP>CO and <SUP>13</SUP>CO molecular line emission of four disks with azimuthal dust asymmetries: HD 135344B, HD 143006, HD 34282, and MWC 758. To assess the vortex features, we constructed an analytical vortex model and performed hydrodynamical simulations. For the latter, we assumed two scenarios: a vortex triggered at the edge of a dead zone and of a gap created by a massive embedded planet. These models reveal a complex kinematical morphology of the vortex. When compared to the data, we find that none of the sources show a distinctive vortex signature around the dust crescents in the kinematics. HD 135344B exhibits a prominent feature similar to the predictions from the simulations, thus making this the most promising target for sensitive follow-up studies at higher resolution and in particular with less abundant molecules at higher resolution and sensitivity to trace closer to the disk midplane.",

        "abstract": "Turbulent gas motions drive planet formation and protoplanetary disk evolution. However, empirical constraints on turbulence are scarce, halting our understanding of its nature. Resolving signatures of the large-scale perturbations driven by disk instabilities may reveal clues on the origin of turbulence in the outer regions of planet-forming disks. We aim to predict the observational signatures of such large-scale flows, as they would appear in high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of CO rotational lines, such as those conducted by the exoALMA Large Program. Post-processing 3D numerical simulations, we explored the observational signatures produced by three candidate (magneto)hydrodynamical instabilities to operate in the outer regions of protoplanetary disks: the vertical shear instability (VSI), the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and the gravitational instability (GI). We found that exoALMA-quality observations should capture signatures of the large-scale motions induced by these instabilities. Mainly, flows with ring, arc, and spiral morphologies are apparent in the residuals of synthetic velocity centroid maps. A qualitative comparison between our predictions and the perturbations recovered from exoALMA data suggests the presence of two laminar disks and a scarcity of ring- and arc-like VSI signatures within the sample. Spiral features produced by the MRI or the GI are still plausible in explaining observed disk perturbations. Supporting these scenarios requires further methodically comparing the predicted perturbations and the observed disks' complex dynamic structure.",

        "abstract": "The availability of exquisite data and the development of new analysis techniques have enabled the study of emitting heights in protoplanetary disks. In this paper, we introduce a simple model linking the emitting height of CO to the disk surface density and temperature structure. We then apply the model to measurements of the emitting height and disk temperature conducted as part of exoALMA, integrated with additional legacy measurements from the MAPS Large Programme, to derive CO column densities and surface density profiles (assuming a CO abundance) for a total of 14 disks. A unique feature of the method we introduce to measure surface densities is that it can be applied to optically thick observations, rather than optically thin as conventionally done. While we use our method on a sample of well-studied disks where temperature structures have been derived using two emission lines, we show that reasonably accurate estimates can be obtained also when only one molecular transition is available. With our method, we obtain independent constraints from <SUP>12</SUP>CO and <SUP>13</SUP>CO, and we find they are in general good agreement using the standard <SUP>12</SUP>C/<SUP>13</SUP>C isotopic ratio. The masses derived from our method are systematically lower compared with the values derived dynamically from the rotation curve if using an interstellar matter (ISM) CO abundance, implying that CO is depleted by a median factor ∼20 with respect to the ISM value, in line with other works that find that CO is depleted in protoplanetary disks.",

        "abstract": "The gas masses of protoplanetary disks are important but elusive quantities. In this work we present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> (3–2) for 11 exoALMA disks. N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> is a molecule sensitive to CO freeze-out and has recently been shown to significantly improve the accuracy of gas masses estimated from CO line emission. We combine these new observations with archival N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> and CO isotopologue observations to measure gas masses for 19 disks, predominantly from the exoALMA large program. For 15 of these disks the gas mass has also been measured using gas rotation curves. We show that the CO + N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> line emission-based gas masses typically agree with the kinematically measured ones within a factor of 3 (∼1σ–2σ). Gas disk masses from CO + N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> are on average a factor of  lower than the kinematic disk masses, which could suggest slightly lower N<SUB>2</SUB> abundances and/or lower midplane ionization rates than typically assumed. Herbig disks are found to have CO gas abundances at the level of the interstellar medium based on their CO and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> fluxes, which sets them apart from T Tauri disks, where abundances are typically ∼3‑30× lower. The agreement between CO + N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>-based and kinematically measured gas masses is promising and shows that multimolecule line fluxes are a robust tool to accurately measure disk masses at least for extended disks.",

        "abstract": "The exoALMA large program offers a unique opportunity to investigate the fundamental properties of protoplanetary disks, such as their masses and sizes, providing important insights into the mechanism responsible for the transport of angular momentum. In this work, we model the rotation curves of CO isotopologues <SUP>12</SUP>CO and <SUP>13</SUP>CO of 10 sources within the exoALMA sample, and we constrain the stellar mass, the disk mass, and the density scale radius through precise characterization of the pressure gradient and disk self-gravity. We obtain dynamical disk masses for our sample by measuring the self-gravitating contribution to the gravitational potential. We are able to parametrically describe their surface density, and all of them appear gravitationally stable. By combining dynamical disk masses with dust continuum emission data, we determine an averaged gas-to-dust ratio of approximately 400, not statistically consistent with the standard value of 100, assuming optically thin dust emission. In addition, the measurement of the dynamical scale radius allows for direct comparison with flux-based radii of gas and dust. This comparison suggests that substructures may influence the size of the dust disk and that CO depletion might reconcile our measurements with thermochemical models. Finally, with the stellar mass, disk mass, scale radius, and accretion rate, and assuming self-similar evolution of the surface density, we constrain the effective α<SUB>S</SUB> for these systems. We find a broad range of α<SUB>S</SUB> values ranging between 10<SUP>‑5</SUP> and 10<SUP>‑2</SUP>.",

We find kinematic signatures that are consistent with planet wakes in six disks: AA Tau, SY Cha, J1842, J1615, LkCa 15, and HD 143006. Comparison with hydrodynamical and radiative transfer simulations suggests planets with orbital radii between 80 and 310 au and masses between 1 and 5 M<SUB>Jup</SUB>. Additional kinematic substructures limit our ability to place tight constraints on the planet masses. When the inclination is favorable to separate the upper and lower surfaces (near 45°, i.e., in 7/15 disks), we always detect the vertical CO snowline and find that the <SUP>12</SUP>CO freeze-out is partial in the disk midplane, with a depletion factor of ≈10<SUP>‑3</SUP> –10<SUP>‑2</SUP> compared to the warm molecular layer. In these same seven disks, we also systematically detect evidence of CO desorption in the outer regions.",

        "abstract": "The planet-hunting Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) large program exoALMA observed 15 protoplanetary disks at  angular resolution and ∼100 m s<SUP>‑1</SUP> spectral resolution, characterizing disk structures and kinematics in enough detail to detect non-Keplerian features (NKFs) in the gas emission. As these features are often small and low-contrast, robust imaging procedures are critical for identifying and characterizing NKFs, including determining which features may be signatures of young planets. The exoALMA collaboration employed two different imaging procedures to ensure the consistent detection of NKFs: CLEAN, the standard iterative deconvolution algorithm, and regularized maximum likelihood (RML) imaging. This Letter presents the exoALMA RML images, obtained by maximizing the likelihood of the visibility data given a model image and subject to regularizer penalties. Crucially, in the context of exoALMA, RML images serve as an independent verification of marginal features seen in the fiducial CLEAN images. However, best practices for synthesizing RML images of multichanneled (i.e., velocity-resolved) data remain undefined, as prior work on RML imaging for protoplanetary disk data has primarily addressed single-image cases. We used the open-source Python package MPoL to explore RML image validation methods for multichanneled data and synthesize RML images from the exoALMA observations of seven protoplanetary disks with apparent NKFs in the <SUP>12</SUP>CO J = 3–2 CLEAN images. We find that RML imaging methods independently reproduce the NKFs seen in the CLEAN images of these sources, suggesting that the NKFs are robust features rather than artifacts from a specific imaging procedure.",

        "abstract": "Extracting robust inferences on physical quantities from disk kinematics measured from Doppler-shifted molecular line emission is challenging due to the data's size and complexity. In this paper, we develop a flexible linear model of the intensity distribution in each frequency channel, accounting for spatial correlations from the point-spread function. The analytic form of the model's posterior enables probabilistic data products through sampling. Our method debiases peak intensity, peak velocity, and line width maps, particularly in disk substructures that are only partially resolved. These are needed in order to measure disk mass, turbulence, and pressure gradients and detect embedded planets. We analyze HD 135344B, MWC 758, and CQ Tau, finding velocity substructures 50–200 m s<SUP>‑1</SUP> greater than with conventional methods. Additionally, we combine our approach with DISCMINER in a case study of J1842. We find that uncertainties in stellar mass and inclination increase by an order of magnitude due to the more realistic noise model. More broadly, our method can be applied to any problem requiring a probabilistic model of an intensity distribution conditioned on a point-spread function.",

        "abstract": "Forward modeling is often used to interpret substructures observed in protoplanetary disks. To ensure the robustness and consistency of the current forward-modeling approach from the community, we conducted a systematic comparison of various hydrodynamics and radiative transfer codes. Using four grid-based hydrodynamics codes (FARGO3D, Idefix, Athena++, and PLUTO) and a smoothed-particle hydrodynamics code (Phantom), we simulated a protoplanetary disk with an embedded giant planet. We then used two radiative transfer codes (mcfost and RADMC-3D) to calculate disk temperatures and create synthetic <SUP>12</SUP>CO cubes. Finally, we retrieved the location of the planet from the synthetic cubes using DISCMINER. We found strong consistency between the hydrodynamics codes, particularly in the density and velocity perturbations associated with planet-driven spirals. We also found a good agreement between the two radiative transfer codes: the disk temperature in mcfost and RADMC-3D models agrees within ≲3% everywhere in the domain. In synthetic <SUP>12</SUP>CO channel maps, this results in brightness temperature differences within ±1.5 K in all our models. This good agreement ensures consistent retrieval of planet's radial/azimuthal location with only a few percent of scatter, with velocity perturbations varying ≲20% among the models. Notably, while the planet-opened gap is shallower in the Phantom simulation, we found that this does not impact the planet location retrieval. In summary, our results demonstrate that any combination of the tested hydrodynamics and radiative transfer codes can be used to reliably model and interpret planet-driven kinematic perturbations.",

        "abstract": "The bulk motion of the gas in protoplanetary disks around newborn stars is nearly Keplerian. By leveraging the high angular and spectral resolution of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), we can detect small-scale velocity perturbations in molecular line observations caused by local gas pressure variations in the disk, possibly induced by embedded protoplanets. This Letter presents the azimuthally averaged rotational velocity and its deviations from Keplerian rotation (δυ<SUB>ϕ</SUB>) for the exoALMA sample, as measured in the <SUP>12</SUP>CO J = 3–2 and <SUP>13</SUP>CO J = 3–2 emission lines. The rotation signatures show evidence for vertically stratified disks, in which <SUP>13</SUP>CO rotates faster than <SUP>12</SUP>CO due to a distinct thermal gas pressure gradient at their emitting heights. We find δυ<SUB>ϕ</SUB> substructures in the sample on both small (∼10 au) and large (∼100 au) radial scales, reaching deviations up to 15% from background Keplerian velocity in the most extreme cases. More than 75% of the rings and 80% of the gaps in the dust continuum emission resolved in δυ<SUB>ϕ</SUB> are colocated with gas pressure maxima and minima, respectively. Additionally, gas pressure substructures are observed far beyond the dust continuum emission. For the first time, we determined the gas pressure derivative at the midplane from observations, and found it to align well with the dust substructures within the given uncertainties. Based on our findings, we conclude that gas pressure variations are likely the dominant mechanism for ring and gap formation in the dust continuum.",

        "abstract": "An analysis of the gaseous component in protoplanetary disks can inform us about their thermal and physical structure, chemical composition, and kinematic properties, all of which are crucial for understanding various processes within the disks. By exploiting the asymmetry of the line emission, or via line profile analysis, we can locate the emitting surfaces. Here, we present the emission surfaces of the exoALMA sources in <SUP>12</SUP>CO J = 3–2, <SUP>13</SUP>CO J = 3–2, and CS J = 7–6. We find that <SUP>12</SUP>CO traces the upper disk atmosphere, with mean <z/r> values of ≈0.28, while <SUP>13</SUP>CO and CS trace lower regions of the disk with mean <z/r> values of ≈0.16 and ≈0.18, respectively. We find that <SUP>12</SUP>CO <z/r> and the disk mass are positively correlated with each other; this relationship offers a straightforward way to infer the disk mass. We derive 2D r – z temperature distributions of the disks. Additionally, we search for substructure in the surfaces and radial intensity profiles; we find evidence of localized substructure in the emission surfaces and peak intensity profiles of nearly every disk, with this substructure often being coincident between molecular tracers, intensity profiles, and kinematic perturbations. Four disks display evidence of potential photodesorption, implying that this effect may be common even in low far-ultraviolet star-forming regions. For most disks, we find that the physical and thermal structure is more complex than analytical models can account for, highlighting a need for more theoretical work and a better understanding of the role of projection effects on our observations.",

        "abstract": "The exoALMA Large Program targeted a sample of 15 disks to study gas dynamics within these systems, and these observations simultaneously produced continuum data at 0.9 mm (331.6 GHz) with exceptional surface brightness sensitivity at high angular resolution. To provide a robust characterization of the observed substructures, we performed a visibility space analysis of the continuum emission from the exoALMA data, characterizing axisymmetric substructures and nonaxisymmetric residuals obtained by subtracting an axisymmetric model from the observed data. We defined a nonaxisymmetry index and found that the most asymmetric disks predominantly show an inner cavity and consistently present higher values of mass accretion rate and near-infrared excess. This suggests a connection between outer disk dust substructures and inner disk properties. The depth of the data allowed us to describe the azimuthally averaged continuum emission in the outer disk, revealing that larger disks (both in dust and gas) in our sample tend to be gradually tapered compared to the sharper outer edge of more compact sources. Additionally, the data quality revealed peculiar features in various sources, such as shadows, inner disk offsets, tentative external substructures, and a possible dust cavity wall.",

        "abstract": "The ALMA large program exoALMA offers a unique window into the three-dimensional physical and dynamical properties of 15 circumstellar disks where planets may be actively forming. Here, we present an analysis methodology to map the gas disk structure and substructure encoded in <SUP>12</SUP>CO, <SUP>13</SUP>CO, and CS line emission from our targets. To model and characterize the disk structure probed by optically thin species, such as CS and, in some cases, <SUP>13</SUP>CO, we introduce a composite line profile kernel that accounts for increased intensities caused by the projected overlap between the disk's front and back side emission. Our workflow, built on the DISCMINER modeling framework, incorporates an improved iterative two-component fitting method for inclined sources (i > 40<SUP>∘</SUP>) to mitigate the impact of the disk back side on the extraction of velocity maps. Also, we report best-fit parameters for the Keplerian stellar masses, as well as inclinations, position angles, systemic velocities, rotation direction, and emission surfaces of the disks in our sample.",

This Letter summarizes the calibration and imaging pipelines used by the exoALMA collaboration. With sources ranging in diameter from  to  when probed by <SUP>12</SUP>CO, multiple antennae configurations were required to maximally recover all spatial information (including Atacama Compact Array data for seven sources). Combining these data sets warranted particular care in their alignment during calibration and prior to imaging so as not to introduce spurious features that might resemble the kinematic deviations being investigated. Phase decoherence was found in several data sets, which was corrected by an iterative self-calibration procedure, and we explored the effects of the order of operations of spatial alignment, flux scaling, and self-calibration. A number of different imaging sets were produced for the continuum and line emission, employing an iterative masking procedure that minimizes bias due to non-Keplerian motions in the disk.",

        "abstract": "Planet formation is a hugely dynamic process requiring the transport, concentration, and assimilation of gas and dust to form the first planetesimals and cores. With access to observations with extremely high spatial and spectral resolution at unprecedented sensitivities, it is now possible to probe the planet-forming environment in detail. To this end, the exoALMA Large Program targeted 15 large protoplanetary disks, ranging between ∼1″ and ∼7″ in radius, and mapped the gas and dust distributions. <SUP>12</SUP>CO J = 3–2, <SUP>13</SUP>CO J = 3–2, and CS J = 7–6 molecular emission was imaged at high angular () and spectral (∼100 m s<SUP>‑1</SUP>) resolution, achieving a surface brightness temperature sensitivity of ∼1.5 K over a single channel, while the 330 GHz continuum emission was imaged at 90 mas resolution and achieved a point source sensitivity of ∼40 μJy beam<SUP>‑1</SUP>. These observations constitute some of the deepest observations of protoplanetary disks to date. Extensive substructure was found in all but one disk, traced by both dust continuum and molecular line emission. In addition, the molecular emission allowed for the velocity structure of the disks to be mapped with excellent precision (uncertainties of the order of 10 m s<SUP>‑1</SUP>), revealing a variety of kinematic perturbations across all sources. From this sample it is clear that, when observed in detail, all disks appear to exhibit physical and dynamical substructure indicative of ongoing dynamical processing due to young, embedded planets, large-scale (magneto)hydrodynamical instabilities or winds.",

        "abstract": "Recent discoveries of transiting giant exoplanets around M dwarfs (GEMS) present an opportunity to investigate their atmospheric compositions and explore how such massive planets can form around low-mass stars contrary to canonical formation models. Here, we present the first transmission spectra of TOI-5205b, a short-period ($P=1.63~\\mathrm{days}$) Jupiter-like planet ($M_p=1.08~\\mathrm{M_J}$ and $R_p=0.94~\\mathrm{R_J}$) orbiting an M4 dwarf. We obtained three transits using the PRISM mode of the JWST Near Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) spanning $0.6-5.3$ um. Our data reveal significant stellar contamination that is evident in the light curves as spot-crossing events and in the transmission spectra as a larger transit depth at bluer wavelengths. Atmospheric retrievals demonstrate that stellar contamination from unocculted star spots is the dominant component of the transmission spectrum at wavelengths $\\lambda\\lesssim3.0$ um, which reduced the sensitivity to the presence of clouds or hazes in our models. The degree of stellar contamination also prevented the definitive detection of any $\\mathrm{H_2O}$, which has primary absorption features at these shorter wavelengths. The broad wavelength coverage of NIRSpec PRISM enabled a robust detection of $\\mathrm{CH_4}$ and $\\mathrm{H_2S}$, which have detectable molecular features between $3.0-5.0$ um. Our gridded and Bayesian retrievals consistently favored an atmosphere with both sub-solar metallicity ($\\log\\mathrm{[M/H]}\\sim-2$ for a clear atmosphere) and super-solar C/O ratio ($\\log\\mathrm{[C/O]}\\sim3$ for a clear or cloudy atmosphere). This contrasts with estimates from planetary interior models that predict a bulk metallicity of 10--20%, which is $\\sim100\\times$ the atmospheric metallicity, and suggests that the planetary interior for TOI-5205b is decoupled from its atmosphere and not well mixed.",

        "abstract": "The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has detected substructures in numerous protoplanetary disks at radii from a few to over 100 au. These substructures are commonly thought to be associated with planet formation, either by serving as sites fostering planetesimal formation or by arising as a consequence of planet–disk interactions. Our current understanding of substructures, though, is primarily based on observations of nearby star-forming regions with mild UV environments, whereas stars are typically born in much harsher UV environments, which may inhibit planet formation in the outer disk through external photoevaporation. We present high-resolution (∼8 au) ALMA 1.3 mm continuum images of eight disks in σ Orionis, a cluster irradiated by an O9.5 star. Gaps and rings are resolved in the images of five disks. The most striking of these is SO 1274, which features five gaps that appear to be arranged nearly in a resonant chain. In addition, we infer the presence of gap or shoulder-like structures in the other three disks through visibility modeling. These observations indicate that substructures robustly form and survive at semimajor axes of several tens of au or less in disks exposed to intermediate levels of external UV radiation as well as in compact disks. However, our observations also suggest that disks in σ Orionis are mostly small, and thus millimeter continuum gaps beyond a disk radius of 50 au are rare in this region, possibly due to either external photoevaporation or age effects.",

        "abstract": "We present MIRI Medium-resolution Spectrograph observations of the large, multi-gapped protoplanetary disk around the T Tauri star AS 209. The observations reveal hundreds of water vapor lines from 4.9–25.5 μm toward the inner ∼1 au in the disk, including the first detection of rovibrational water emission in this disk. The spectrum is dominated by hot (∼800 K) water vapor and OH gas, with only marginal detections of CO<SUB>2</SUB>, HCN, and a possible colder water vapor component. Using slab models with a detailed treatment of opacities and line overlap, we retrieve the column density, emitting area, and excitation temperature of water vapor and OH, and provide upper limits for the observable mass of other molecules. Compared to MIRI spectra of other T Tauri disks, the inner disk of AS 209 does not appear to be atypically depleted in CO<SUB>2</SUB> nor HCN. Based on Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph observations, we further find evidence for molecular emission variability over a 10 yr baseline. Water, OH, and CO<SUB>2</SUB> line luminosities have decreased by factors of 2–4 in the new MIRI epoch, yet there are minimal continuum emission variations. The origin of this variability is yet to be understood.",

        "abstract": "We present new spatially resolved astrometry and photometry of the CD -27°11535 system, a member of the β Pictoris moving group consisting of two resolved K-type stars on a ~20 yr orbit. We fit an orbit to relative astrometry measured from NIRC2, GPI, and archival NaCo images, in addition to literature measurements. However, the total mass inferred from this orbit is significantly discrepant from that inferred from stellar evolutionary models using the luminosity of the two stars. We explore two hypotheses that could explain this discrepant mass sum: a discrepant parallax measurement from Gaia due to variability, and the presence of an additional unresolved companion to one of the two components. We find that the ~20 yr orbit could not bias the parallax measurement, but that variability of the components could produce a large-amplitude astrometric motion, an effect that cannot be quantified exactly without the individual Gaia measurements. The discrepancy could also be explained by an additional star in the system. We jointly fit the astrometric and photometric measurements of the system to test different binary and triple architectures for the system. Depending on the set of evolutionary models used, we find an improved goodness of fit for a triple system architecture that includes a low-mass (M = 0.177 ± 0.055 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) companion to the primary star. Further studies of this system will be required in order to resolve this discrepancy, either by refining the parallax measurement with a more complex treatment of variability-induced astrometric motion or by detecting a third companion.",

        "abstract": "Regularized Maximum Likelihood (RML) techniques are a class of image synthesis methods that achieve better angular resolution and image fidelity than traditional methods like CLEAN for sub-mm interferometric observations. To identify best practices for RML imaging, we used the GPU-accelerated open source Python package MPoL, a machine learning-based RML approach, to explore the influence of common RML regularizers (maximum entropy, sparsity, total variation, and total squared variation) on images reconstructed from real and synthetic Atacama Large millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) continuum observations of protoplanetary disks. We tested two different cross-validation (CV) procedures to characterize their performance and determine optimal prior strengths, and found that CV over a coarse grid of regularization strengths easily identifies a range of models with comparably strong predictive power. To evaluate the performance of RML techniques against a ground truth image, we used MPoL on a synthetic protoplanetary disk data set and found that RML methods successfully resolve structures at fine spatial scales present in the original simulation. We used ALMA DSHARP observations of the protoplanetary disk around HD 143006 to compare the performance of MPoL and CLEAN, finding that RML imaging improved the spatial resolution of the image by up to a factor of 3 without sacrificing sensitivity. We provide general recommendations for building an RML workflow for image synthesis of ALMA protoplanetary disk observations, including effective use of CV. Using these techniques to improve the imaging resolution of protoplanetary disk observations will enable new science, including the detection of protoplanets embedded in disks.",

We derive the radial, azimuthal, and vertical velocity of the gas, taking into account the lowered emission surface near the annular gap at ≃1.″7 (200 au) within which a candidate circumplanetary-disk-hosting planet has been reported previously. In <SUP>12</SUP>CO and <SUP>13</SUP>CO, we find a coherent upward flow arising from the gap. The upward gas flow is as fast as 150 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> in the regions traced by <SUP>12</SUP>CO emission, which corresponds to about 50% of the local sound speed or 6% of the local Keplerian speed. Such an upward gas flow is difficult to reconcile with an embedded planet alone. Instead, we propose that magnetically driven winds via ambipolar diffusion are triggered by the low gas density within the planet-carved gap, dominating the kinematics of the gap region. We estimate the ambipolar Elsässer number, Am, using the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> column density as a proxy for ion density and find that Am is ~0.1 at the radial location of the upward flow. This value is broadly consistent with the value at which numerical simulations find that ambipolar diffusion drives strong winds. We hypothesize that the activation of magnetically driven winds in a planet-carved gap can control the growth of the embedded planet. We provide a scaling relationship that describes the wind-regulated terminal mass: adopting parameters relevant to 100 au from a solar-mass star, we find that the wind-regulated terminal mass is about one Jupiter mass, which may help explain the dearth of directly imaged super-Jovian-mass planets.",

        "abstract": "We report the discovery of a circumplanetary disk (CPD) candidate embedded in the circumstellar disk of the T Tauri star AS 209 at a radial distance of about 200 au (on-sky separation of 1.″4 from the star at a position angle of 161°), isolated via <SUP>13</SUP>CO J = 2-1 emission. This is the first instance of CPD detection via gaseous emission capable of tracing the overall CPD mass. The CPD is spatially unresolved with a 117 × 82 mas beam and manifests as a point source in <SUP>13</SUP>CO, indicating that its diameter is ≲14 au. The CPD is embedded within an annular gap in the circumstellar disk previously identified using <SUP>12</SUP>CO and near-infrared scattered-light observations and is associated with localized velocity perturbations in <SUP>12</SUP>CO. The coincidence of these features suggests that they have a common origin: an embedded giant planet. We use the <SUP>13</SUP>CO intensity to constrain the CPD gas temperature and mass. We find that the CPD temperature is ≳35 K, higher than the circumstellar disk temperature at the radial location of the CPD, 22 K, suggesting that heating sources localized to the CPD must be present. The CPD gas mass is ≳0.095 M <SUB>Jup</SUB> ≃ 30 M <SUB>⊕</SUB> adopting a standard <SUP>13</SUP>CO abundance. From the nondetection of millimeter continuum emission at the location of the CPD (3σ flux density ≲26.4 μJy), we infer that the CPD dust mass is ≲0.027 M <SUB>⊕</SUB> ≃ 2.2 lunar masses, indicating a low dust-to-gas mass ratio of ≲9 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP>. We discuss the formation mechanism of the CPD-hosting giant planet on a wide orbit in the framework of gravitational instability and pebble accretion.",

        "abstract": "The four directly imaged planets orbiting the star HR 8799 are an ideal laboratory to probe atmospheric physics and formation models. We present more than a decade's worth of Keck/OSIRIS observations of these planets, which represent the most detailed look at their atmospheres to date by its resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. We present the first direct detection of HR 8799 d, the second-closest known planet to the star, at moderate spectral resolution with Keck/OSIRIS (K band; R ≈ 4000). Additionally, we uniformly analyze new and archival OSIRIS data (H and K band) of HR 8799 b, c, and d. First, we show detections of water (H<SUB>2</SUB>O) and carbon monoxide (CO) in the three planets and discuss the ambiguous case of methane (CH<SUB>4</SUB>) in the atmosphere of HR 8799 b. Then, we report radial-velocity (RV) measurements for each of the three planets. The RV measurement of HR 8799 d is consistent with predictions made assuming coplanarity and orbital stability of the HR 8799 planetary system. Finally, we perform a uniform atmospheric analysis on the OSIRIS data, published photometric points, and low-resolution spectra. We do not infer any significant deviation from the stellar value of the carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) of the three planets, which therefore does not yet yield definitive information about the location or method of formation. However, constraining the C/O for all the HR 8799 planets is a milestone for any multiplanet system, and particularly important for large, widely separated gas giants with uncertain formation processes.",

        "abstract": "The mass of a star is the most fundamental parameter for its structure, evolution, and final fate. It is particularly important for any kind of stellar archaeology and characterization of exoplanets. There exist a variety of methods in astronomy to estimate or determine it. In this review we present a significant number of such methods, beginning with the most direct and model-independent approach using detached eclipsing binaries. We then move to more indirect and model-dependent methods, such as the quite commonly used isochrone or stellar track fitting. The arrival of quantitative asteroseismology has opened a completely new approach to determine stellar masses and to complement and improve the accuracy of other methods. We include methods for different evolutionary stages, from the pre-main sequence to evolved (super)giants and final remnants. For all methods uncertainties and restrictions will be discussed. We provide lists of altogether more than 200 benchmark stars with relative mass accuracies between [0.3 ,2 ]% for the covered mass range of M ∈[0.1 ,16 ] M<SUB>⊙</SUB> , 75 % of which are stars burning hydrogen in their core and the other 25 % covering all other evolved stages. We close with a recommendation how to combine various methods to arrive at a \"mass-ladder\" for stars.",

        "abstract": "Gas mass remains one of the most difficult protoplanetary disk properties to constrain. With much of the protoplanetary disk too cold for the main gas constituent, H<SUB>2</SUB>, to emit, alternative tracers such as dust, CO, or the H<SUB>2</SUB> isotopologue HD are used. However, relying on disk mass measurements from any single tracer requires assumptions about the tracer's abundance relative to H<SUB>2</SUB> and the disk temperature structure. Using new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations from the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) ALMA Large Program as well as archival ALMA observations, we construct a disk physical/chemical model of the protoplanetary disk GM Aur. Our model is in good agreement with the spatially resolved CO isotopologue emission from 11 rotational transitions with spatial resolution ranging from 0\"15 to 0\"46 (24-73 au at 159 pc) and the spatially unresolved HD J = 1-0 detection from Herschel. Our best-fit model favors a cold protoplanetary disk with a total gas mass of approximately 0.2 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, a factor of 10 reduction in CO gas inside roughly 100 au and a factor of 100 reduction outside of 100 au. Despite its large mass, the disk appears to be on the whole gravitationally stable based on the derived Toomre Q parameter. However, the region between 70 and 100 au, corresponding to one of the millimeter dust rings, is close to being unstable based on the calculated Toomre Q of <1.7.

We present an analysis of complex features identified around GM Aur in <SUP>12</SUP>CO J = 2 - 1 images at a spatial resolution of ~40 au. In addition to a Keplerian disk extending to a radius of ~550 au, the CO emission traces flocculent spiral arms out to radii of ~1200 au, a tail extending ~1800 au southwest of GM Aur, and diffuse structures extending from the north side of the disk up to radii of ~1900 au. The diffuse structures coincide with a \"dust ribbon\" previously identified in scattered light. The large-scale asymmetric gas features present a striking contrast with the mostly axisymmetric, multi-ringed millimeter continuum tracing the pebble disk. We hypothesize that GM Aur's complex gas structures result from late infall of remnant envelope or cloud material onto the disk. The morphological similarities to the SU Aur and AB Aur systems, which are also located in the L1517 cloud, provide additional support to a scenario in which interactions with the environment are playing a role in regulating the distribution and transport of material in all three of these Class II disk systems.

        "abstract": "We explore the dynamical structure of the protoplanetary disks surrounding HD 163296 and MWC 480 as part of the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) large program. Using the J = 2-1 transitions of <SUP>12</SUP>CO, <SUP>13</SUP>CO, and C<SUP>18</SUP>O imaged at spatial resolutions of ~0\"15 and with a channel spacing of 200 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>, we find perturbations from Keplerian rotation in the projected velocity fields of both disks (≲5% of the local Keplerian velocity), suggestive of large-scale (tens of astronomical units in size), coherent flows. By accounting for the azimuthal dependence on the projection of the velocity field, the velocity fields were decomposed into azimuthally averaged orthogonal components, v<SUB>φ</SUB>, v<SUB>r</SUB>, and v<SUB>z</SUB>. Using the optically thick <SUP>12</SUP>CO emission as a probe of the gas temperature, local variations of ≈3 K (≈5% relative changes) were observed and found to be associated with the kinematic substructures. The MWC 480 disk hosts a suite of tightly wound spiral arms. The spirals arms, in conjunction with the highly localized perturbations in the gas velocity structure (kinematic planetary signatures), indicate a giant planet, ~1 M<SUB>Jup</SUB>, at a radius of ≈245 au. In the disk of HD 163296, the kinematic substructures were consistent with previous studies of Pinte et al. and Teague et al. advocating for multiple ~1 M<SUB>Jup</SUB> planets embedded in the disk. These results demonstrate that molecular line observations that characterize the dynamical structure of disks can be used to search for the signatures of embedded planets.

        "abstract": "Understanding the temperature structure of protoplanetary disks is key to interpreting observations, predicting the physical and chemical evolution of the disk, and modeling planet formation processes. In this study, we constrain the two-dimensional thermal structure of the disk around the Herbig Ae star HD 163296. Using the thermochemical code RAC2D, we derive a thermal structure that reproduces spatially resolved Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations (~0\"12 (13 au)-0\"25 (26 au)) of <SUP>12</SUP>CO J = 2 - 1, <SUP>13</SUP>CO J = 1 - 0, 2 - 1, C<SUP>18</SUP>O J = 1 - 0, 2 - 1, and C<SUP>17</SUP>O J = 1 - 0, the HD J = 1 - 0 flux upper limit, the spectral energy distribution (SED), and continuum morphology. The final model incorporates both a radial depletion of CO motivated by a timescale shorter than typical CO gas-phase chemistry (0.01 Myr) and an enhanced temperature near the surface layer of the the inner disk (z/r ≥ 0.21). This model agrees with the majority of the empirically derived temperatures and observed emitting surfaces derived from the J = 2 - 1 CO observations. We find an upper limit for the disk mass of 0.35 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, using the upper limit of the HD J = 1 - 0 and J = 2 - 1 flux. With our final thermal structure, we explore the impact that gaps have on the temperature structure constrained by observations of the resolved gaps. Adding a large gap in the gas and small dust additionally increases gas temperature in the gap by only 5%-10%. This paper is part of the MAPS special issue of the Astrophysical Journal Supplement.",

        "abstract": "During the main phase of evolution of a protoplanetary disk, accretion regulates the inner-disk properties, such as the temperature and mass distribution, and in turn, the physical conditions associated with planet formation. The driving mechanism behind accretion remains uncertain; however, one promising mechanism is the removal of a fraction of angular momentum via a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk wind launched from the inner tens of astronomical units of the disk. This paper utilizes CO isotopologue emission to study the unique molecular outflow originating from the HD 163296 protoplanetary disk obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. HD 163296 is one of the most well-studied Class II disks and is proposed to host multiple gas-giant planets. We robustly detect the large-scale rotating outflow in the <SUP>12</SUP>CO J = 2 - 1 and the <SUP>13</SUP>CO J = 2 - 1 and J = 1 - 0 transitions. We constrain the kinematics, the excitation temperature of the molecular gas, and the mass-loss rate. The high ratio of the rates of ejection to accretion (5-50), together with the rotation signatures of the flow, provides solid evidence for an MHD disk wind. We find that the angular momentum removal by the wind is sufficient to drive accretion though the inner region of the disk; therefore, accretion driven by turbulent viscosity is not required to explain HD 163296's accretion. The low temperature of the molecular wind and its overall kinematics suggest that the MHD disk wind could be perturbed and shocked by the previously observed high-velocity atomic jet.

        "abstract": "Constraining the distribution of gas and dust in the inner 20 au of protoplanetary disks is difficult. At the same time, this region is thought to be responsible for most planet formation, especially around the water ice line at 3-10 au. Under the assumption that the gas is in a Keplerian disk, we use the exquisite sensitivity of the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) ALMA large program to construct radial surface brightness profiles with a ~3 au effective resolution for the CO isotopologue J = 2-1 lines using the line velocity profile. IM Lup reveals a central depression in <SUP>13</SUP>CO and C<SUP>18</SUP>O that is ascribed to a pileup of ~500 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> of dust in the inner 20 au, leading to a gas-to-dust ratio of around <10. This pileup is consistent with an efficient drift of grains (≳100 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> Myr<SUP>-1</SUP>) and a local gas-to-dust ratio that suggests that the streaming instability could be active. The CO isotopologue emission in the GM Aur disk is consistent with a small (~15 au), strongly depleted gas cavity within the ~40 au dust cavity. The radial surface brightness profiles for both the AS 209 and HD 163296 disks show a local minimum and maximum in the C<SUP>18</SUP>O emission at the location of a known dust ring (~14 au) and gap (~10 au), respectively. This indicates that the dust ring has a low gas-to-dust ratio (>10) and that the dust gap is gas-rich enough to have optically thick C<SUP>18</SUP>O.

        "abstract": "Constraining dust properties of planet-forming disks via high-angular-resolution observations is fundamental to understanding how solids are trapped in substructures and how dust growth may be favored or accelerated therein. We use ALMA dust continuum observations of the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) disks and explore a large parameter space to constrain the radial distribution of solid mass and maximum grain size in each disk, including or excluding dust scattering. In the nonscattering model, the dust surface density and maximum grain size profiles decrease from the inner disks to the outer disks, with local maxima at the bright ring locations, as expected from dust trapping models. The inferred maximum grain sizes from the inner to outer disks decrease from 1 cm to 1 mm. For IM Lup, HD 163296, and MWC 480 in the scattering model, two solutions are compatible with their observed inner disk emission: one solution corresponding to a maximum grain size of a few millimeters (similar to the nonscattering model), and the other corresponding to a size of a few hundred micrometers. Based on the estimated Toomre parameter, only IM Lup-which shows a prominent spiral morphology in millimeter dust-is found to be gravitationally unstable. The estimated maximum Stokes number in all the disks lies between 0.01 and 0.3, and the estimated turbulence parameters in the rings of AS 209 and HD 163296 are close to the threshold where dust growth is limited by turbulent fragmentation. This paper is part of the MAPS special issue of the Astrophysical Journal Supplement.",

HCO<SUP>+</SUP> is detected and mapped at 0\"3 resolution in all five disks, while H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> is detected (S/N > 6σ) toward GM Aur and HD 163296 and tentatively detected (S/N > 3σ) toward the other disks by a matched filter analysis. Inside a radius of R ~ 100 au, the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> column density is flat or shows a central dip. At outer radii (≳100 au), the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> column density decreases outward, while the column density ratio of HCO<SUP>+</SUP>/CO is mostly in the range of ~10<SUP>-5</SUP>-10<SUP>-4</SUP>. We derived the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> abundance in the warm CO-rich layer, where HCO<SUP>+</SUP> is expected to be the dominant molecular ion. At R ≳ 100 au, the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> abundance is ~3 × 10<SUP>-11</SUP> - 3 × 10<SUP>-10</SUP>, which is consistent with a template disk model with X-ray ionization. At the smaller radii, the abundance decreases inward, which indicates that the ionization degree is lower in denser gas, especially inside the CO snow line, where the CO-rich layer is in the midplane. Comparison of template disk models with the column densities of HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>, and N<SUB>2</SUB>D<SUP>+</SUP> indicates that the midplane ionization rate is ≳10<SUP>-18</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP> for the disks around IM Lup, AS 209, and HD 163296. We also find hints of an increased HCO<SUP>+</SUP> abundance around the location of dust continuum gaps in AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480.

        "abstract": "Sulfur-bearing molecules play an important role in prebiotic chemistry and planet habitability. They are also proposed probes of chemical ages, elemental C/O ratio, and grain chemistry processing. Commonly detected in diverse astrophysical objects, including the solar system, their distribution and chemistry remain, however, largely unknown in planet-forming disks. We present CS (2 - 1) observations at ~0\"3 resolution performed within the ALMA MAPS Large Program toward the five disks around IM Lup, GM Aur, AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480. CS is detected in all five disks, displaying a variety of radial intensity profiles and spatial distributions across the sample, including intriguing apparent azimuthal asymmetries. Transitions of C<SUB>2</SUB>S and SO were also serendipitously covered, but only upper limits are found. For MWC 480, we present complementary ALMA observations at ~ 0\"5 of CS, <SUP>13</SUP>CS, C<SUP>34</SUP>S, H<SUB>2</SUB>CS, OCS, and SO<SUB>2</SUB>. We find a column density ratio N(H<SUB>2</SUB>CS)/N(CS) ~ 2/3, suggesting that a substantial part of the sulfur reservoir in disks is in organic form (i.e., C<SUB>x</SUB>H<SUB>y</SUB>S<SUB>z</SUB>). Using astrochemical disk modeling tuned to MWC 480, we demonstrate that N(CS)/N(SO) is a promising probe for the elemental C/O ratio. The comparison with the observations provides a supersolar C/O. We also find a depleted gas-phase S/H ratio, suggesting either that part of the sulfur reservoir is locked in solid phase or that it remains in an unidentified gas-phase reservoir.

        "abstract": "UV photochemistry in the surface layers of protoplanetary disks dramatically alters their composition relative to previous stages of star formation. The abundance ratio CN/HCN has long been proposed to trace the UV field in various astrophysical objects; however, to date the relationship between CN, HCN, and the UV field in disks remains ambiguous. As part of the ALMA Large Program MAPS (Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales), we present observations of CN N = 1-0 transitions at 0.″3 resolution toward five disk systems. All disks show bright CN emission within ~50-150 au, along with a diffuse emission shelf extending up to 600 au. In all sources we find that the CN/HCN column density ratio increases with disk radius from about unity to 100, likely tracing increased UV penetration that enhances selective HCN photodissociation in the outer disk. Additionally, multiple millimeter dust gaps and rings coincide with peaks and troughs, respectively, in the CN/HCN ratio, implying that some millimeter substructures are accompanied by changes to the UV penetration in more elevated disk layers. That the CN/HCN ratio is generally high (>1) points to a robust photochemistry shaping disk chemical compositions and also means that CN is the dominant carrier of the prebiotically interesting nitrile group at most disk radii. We also find that the local column densities of CN and HCN are positively correlated despite emitting from vertically stratified disk regions, indicating that different disk layers are chemically linked.

        "abstract": "Deuterium fractionation is dependent on various physical and chemical parameters. Thus, the formation location and thermal history of material in the solar system is often studied by measuring its D/H ratio. This requires knowledge about the deuteration processes operating during the planet formation era. We aim to study these processes by radially resolving the DCN/HCN (at 0\"3 resolution) and N<SUB>2</SUB>D<SUP>+</SUP>/N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> (~0\"3-0\"9) column density ratios toward the five protoplanetary disks observed by the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming scales (MAPS) Large Program. DCN is detected in all five sources, with one newly reported detection. N<SUB>2</SUB>D<SUP>+</SUP> is detected in four sources, two of which are newly reported detections. We derive column density profiles that allow us to study the spatial variation of the DCN/HCN and N<SUB>2</SUB>D<SUP>+</SUP>/N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> ratios at high resolution. DCN/HCN varies considerably for different parts of the disks, ranging from 10<SUP>-3</SUP> to 10<SUP>-1</SUP>. In particular, the inner-disk regions generally show significantly lower HCN deuteration compared with the outer disk. In addition, our analysis confirms that two deuterium fractionation channels are active, which can alter the D/H ratio within the pool of organic molecules. N<SUB>2</SUB>D<SUP>+</SUP> is found in the cold outer regions beyond ~50 au, with N<SUB>2</SUB>D<SUP>+</SUP>/N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> ranging between 10<SUP>-2</SUP> and 1 across the disk sample. This is consistent with the theoretical expectation that N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> deuteration proceeds via the low-temperature channel only.

        "abstract": "The precursors to larger, biologically relevant molecules are detected throughout interstellar space, but determining the presence and properties of these molecules during planet formation requires observations of protoplanetary disks at high angular resolution and sensitivity. Here, we present 0\"3 observations of HC<SUB>3</SUB>N, CH<SUB>3</SUB>CN, and c-C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB> in five protoplanetary disks observed as part of the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) Large Program. We robustly detect all molecules in four of the disks (GM Aur, AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480) with tentative detections of c-C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB> and CH<SUB>3</SUB>CN in IM Lup. We observe a range of morphologies-central peaks, single or double rings-with no clear correlation in morphology between molecule or disk. Emission is generally compact and on scales comparable with the millimeter dust continuum. We perform both disk-integrated and radially resolved rotational diagram analysis to derive column densities and rotational temperatures. The latter reveals 5-10 times more column density in the inner 50-100 au of the disks when compared with the disk-integrated analysis. We demonstrate that CH<SUB>3</SUB>CN originates from lower relative heights in the disks when compared with HC<SUB>3</SUB>N, in some cases directly tracing the disk midplane. Finally, we find good agreement between the ratio of small to large nitriles in the outer disks and comets. Our results indicate that the protoplanetary disks studied here are host to significant reservoirs of large organic molecules, and that this planet- and comet-building material can be chemically similar to that in our own solar system.

        "abstract": "Emission substructures in gas and dust are common in protoplanetary disks. Such substructures can be linked to planet formation or planets themselves. We explore the observed gas substructures in AS 209 using thermochemical modeling with RAC2D and high-spatial-resolution data from the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) program. The observations of C<SUP>18</SUP>O J = 2-1 emission exhibit a strong depression at 88 au overlapping with the positions of multiple gaps in millimeter dust continuum emission. We find that the observed CO column density is consistent with either gas surface-density perturbations or chemical processing, while C<SUB>2</SUB>H column density traces changes in the C/O ratio rather than the H<SUB>2</SUB> gas surface density. However, the presence of a massive planet (>0.2 M<SUB>Jup</SUB>) would be required to account for this level of gas depression, which conflicts with constraints set by the dust emission and the pressure profile measured by gas kinematics. Based on our models, we infer that a local decrease of CO abundance is required to explain the observed structure in CO, dominating over a possible gap-carving planet present and its effect on the H<SUB>2</SUB> surface density.

        "abstract": "The elemental composition of the gas and dust in a protoplanetary disk influences the compositions of the planets that form in it. We use the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) data to constrain the elemental composition of the gas at the locations of potentially forming planets. The elemental abundances are inferred by comparing source-specific gas-grain thermochemical models with variable C/O ratios and small-grain abundances from the DALI code with CO and C<SUB>2</SUB>H column densities derived from the high-resolution observations of the disks of AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480. Elevated C/O ratios (~2.0), even within the CO ice line, are necessary to match the inferred C<SUB>2</SUB>H column densities over most of the pebble disk. Combined with constraints on the CO abundances in these systems, this implies that both the O/H and C/H ratios in the gas are substellar by a factor of 4-10, with the O/H depleted by a factor of 20-50, resulting in the high C/O ratios. This necessitates that even within the CO ice line, most of the volatile carbon and oxygen is still trapped on grains in the midplane. Planets accreting gas in the gaps of the AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480 disks will thus acquire very little carbon and oxygen after reaching the pebble isolation mass. In the absence of atmosphere-enriching events, these planets would thus have a strongly substellar O/H and C/H and superstellar C/O atmospheric composition.

        "abstract": "Small organic molecules, such as C<SUB>2</SUB>H, HCN, and H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, are tracers of the C, N, and O budget in protoplanetary disks. We present high-angular-resolution (10-50 au) observations of C<SUB>2</SUB>H, HCN, and H<SUB>2</SUB>CO lines in five protoplanetary disks from the Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) ALMA Large Program. We derive column density and excitation temperature profiles for HCN and C<SUB>2</SUB>H, and find that the HCN emission arises in a temperate (20-30 K) layer in the disk, while C<SUB>2</SUB>H is present in relatively warmer (20-60 K) layers. In the case of HD 163296, we find a decrease in column density for HCN and C<SUB>2</SUB>H inside one of the dust gaps near ~83 au, where a planet has been proposed to be located. We derive H<SUB>2</SUB>CO column density profiles assuming temperatures between 20 and 50 K, and find slightly higher column densities in the colder disks around T Tauri stars than around Herbig Ae stars. The H<SUB>2</SUB>CO column densities rise near the location of the CO snowline and/or millimeter dust edge, suggesting an efficient release of H<SUB>2</SUB>CO ices in the outer disk. Finally, we find that the inner 50 au of these disks are rich in organic species, with abundances relative to water that are similar to cometary values. Comets could therefore deliver water and key organics to future planets in these disks, similar to what might have happened here on Earth.

        "abstract": "Here we present high-resolution (15-24 au) observations of CO isotopologue lines from the Molecules with ALMA on Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) ALMA Large Program. Our analysis employs observations of the (J = 2-1) and (1-0) lines of <SUP>13</SUP>CO and C<SUP>18</SUP>O and the (J = 1-0) line of C<SUP>17</SUP>O for five protoplanetary disks. We retrieve CO gas density distributions, using three independent methods: (1) a thermochemical modeling framework based on the CO data, the broadband spectral energy distribution, and the millimeter continuum emission; (2) an empirical temperature distribution based on optically thick CO lines; and (3) a direct fit to the C<SUP>17</SUP>O hyperfine lines. Results from these methods generally show excellent agreement. The CO gas column density profiles of the five disks show significant variations in the absolute value and the radial shape. Assuming a gas-to-dust mass ratio of 100, all five disks have a global CO-to-H<SUB>2</SUB> abundance 10-100 times lower than the interstellar medium ratio. The CO gas distributions between 150 and 400 au match well with models of viscous disks, supporting the long-standing theory. CO gas gaps appear to be correlated with continuum gap locations, but some deep continuum gaps do not have corresponding CO gaps. The relative depths of CO and dust gaps are generally consistent with predictions of planet-disk interactions, but some CO gaps are 5-10 times shallower than predictions based on dust gaps.

        "abstract": "The Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) Large Program provides a unique opportunity to study the vertical distribution of gas, chemistry, and temperature in the protoplanetary disks around IM Lup, GM Aur, AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480. By using the asymmetry of molecular line emission relative to the disk major axis, we infer the emission height (z) above the midplane as a function of radius (r). Using this method, we measure emitting surfaces for a suite of CO isotopologues, HCN, and C<SUB>2</SUB>H. We find that <SUP>12</SUP>CO emission traces the most elevated regions with $z/r 0.3$ , while emission from the less abundant <SUP>13</SUP>CO and C<SUP>18</SUP>O probes deeper into the disk at altitudes of $z/r\\,\\lesssim \\,0.2$ . C<SUB>2</SUB>H and HCN have lower opacities and signal-to-noise ratios, making surface fitting more difficult, and could only be reliably constrained in AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480, with $z/r\\,\\lesssim \\,0.1$ , i.e., relatively close to the planet-forming midplanes. We determine peak brightness temperatures of the optically thick CO isotopologues and use these to trace 2D disk temperature structures. Several CO temperature profiles and emission surfaces show dips in temperature or vertical height, some of which are associated with gaps and rings in line and/or continuum emission. These substructures may be due to local changes in CO column density, gas surface density, or gas temperatures, and detailed thermochemical models are necessary to better constrain their origins and relate the chemical compositions of elevated disk layers with those of planet-forming material in disk midplanes.

        "abstract": "The Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) Large Program provides a detailed, high-resolution (~10-20 au) view of molecular line emission in five protoplanetary disks at spatial scales relevant for planet formation. Here we present a systematic analysis of chemical substructures in 18 molecular lines toward the MAPS sources: IM Lup, GM Aur, AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480. We identify more than 200 chemical substructures, which are found at nearly all radii where line emission is detected. A wide diversity of radial morphologies-including rings, gaps, and plateaus-is observed both within each disk and across the MAPS sample. This diversity in line emission profiles is also present in the innermost 50 au. Overall, this suggests that planets form in varied chemical environments both across disks and at different radii within the same disk. Interior to 150 au, the majority of chemical substructures across the MAPS disks are spatially coincident with substructures in the millimeter continuum, indicative of physical and chemical links between the disk midplane and warm, elevated molecular emission layers. Some chemical substructures in the inner disk and most chemical substructures exterior to 150 au cannot be directly linked to dust substructure, however, which indicates that there are also other causes of chemical substructures, such as snowlines, gradients in UV photon fluxes, ionization, and radially varying elemental ratios. This implies that chemical substructures could be developed into powerful probes of different disk characteristics, in addition to influencing the environments within which planets assemble.

        "abstract": "The Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales Large Program (MAPS LP) surveyed the chemical structures of five protoplanetary disks across more than 40 different spectral lines at high angular resolution (0\"15 and 0\"30 beams for Bands 6 and 3, respectively) and sensitivity (spanning 0.3-1.3 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP> and 0.4-1.9 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP> for Bands 6 and 3, respectively). In this article, we describe the multistage workflow-built around the CASA tclean image deconvolution procedure-that we used to generate the core data product of the MAPS LP: the position-position-velocity image cubes for each spectral line. Owing to the expansive nature of the survey, we encountered a range of imaging challenges: some are familiar to the submillimeter protoplanetary disk community, like the need to use an accurate CLEAN mask, and others are less well known, like the incorrect default flux scaling of the CLEAN residual map first described by Jorsater & van Moorsel (the \"JvM effect\"). We distill lessons learned into recommended workflows for synthesizing image cubes of molecular emission. In particular, we describe how to produce image cubes with accurate fluxes via \"JvM correction,\" a procedure that is generally applicable to any image synthesized via CLEAN deconvolution but is especially critical for low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) emission. We further explain how we used visibility tapering to promote a common, fiducial beam size and contextualize the interpretation of S/N when detecting molecular emission from protoplanetary disks.

        "abstract": "Planets form and obtain their compositions in dust- and gas-rich disks around young stars, and the outcome of this process is intimately linked to the disk chemical properties. The distributions of molecules across disks regulate the elemental compositions of planets, including C/N/O/S ratios and metallicity (O/H and C/H), as well as access to water and prebiotically relevant organics. Emission from molecules also encodes information on disk ionization levels, temperature structures, kinematics, and gas surface densities, which are all key ingredients of disk evolution and planet formation models. The Molecules with ALMA at Planet-forming Scales (MAPS) ALMA Large Program was designed to expand our understanding of the chemistry of planet formation by exploring disk chemical structures down to 10 au scales. The MAPS program focuses on five disks-around IM Lup, GM Aur, AS 209, HD 163296, and MWC 480-in which dust substructures are detected and planet formation appears to be ongoing. We observed these disks in four spectral setups, which together cover ~50 lines from over 20 different species. This paper introduces the Astrophysical Journal Supplement's MAPS Special Issue by presenting an overview of the program motivation, disk sample, observational details, and calibration strategy. We also highlight key results, including discoveries of links between dust, gas, and chemical substructures, large reservoirs of nitriles and other organics in the inner disk regions, and elevated C/O ratios across most disks. We discuss how this collection of results is reshaping our view of the chemistry of planet formation.",

        "abstract": "PDS 70 is a unique system in which two protoplanets, PDS 70 b and c, have been discovered within the dust-depleted cavity of their disk, at ~22 and 34 au, respectively, by direct imaging at infrared wavelengths. Subsequent detection of the planets in the Hα line indicates that they are still accreting material through circumplanetary disks. In this Letter, we present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the dust continuum emission at 855 μm at high angular resolution (~20 mas, 2.3 au) that aim to resolve the circumplanetary disks and constrain their dust masses. Our observations confirm the presence of a compact source of emission co-located with PDS 70 c, spatially separated from the circumstellar disk and less extended than ~1.2 au in radius, a value close to the expected truncation radius of the circumplanetary disk at a third of the Hill radius. The emission around PDS 70 c has a peak intensity of ~86 ± 16 μJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>, which corresponds to a dust mass of ~0.031 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> or ~0.007 M<SUB>⊕</SUB>, assuming that it is only constituted of 1 μm or 1 mm sized grains, respectively. We also detect extended, low surface brightness continuum emission within the cavity near PDS 70 b. We observe an optically thin inner disk within 18 au of the star with an emission that could result from small micron-sized grains transported from the outer disk through the orbits of b and c. In addition, we find that the outer disk resolves into a narrow and bright ring with a faint inner shoulder.",

        "abstract": "\"exoplanet\" is a toolkit for probabilistic modeling of astronomical time series data, with a focus on observations of exoplanets, using PyMC3 (Salvatier et al., 2016). PyMC3 is a flexible and high-performance model-building language and inference engine that scales well to problems with a large number of parameters. \"exoplanet\" extends PyMC3's modeling language to support many of the custom functions and probability distributions required when fitting exoplanet datasets or other astronomical time series. While it has been used for other applications, such as the study of stellar variability, the primary purpose of \"exoplanet\" is the characterization of exoplanets or multiple star systems using time-series photometry, astrometry, and/or radial velocity. In particular, the typical use case would be to use one or more of these datasets to place constraints on the physical and orbital parameters of the system, such as planet mass or orbital period, while simultaneously taking into account the effects of stellar variability.",

From models of the spectral energy distribution, we found the inner radius of the circumbinary disk (r<SUB>inner</SUB> = 0.50-0.75 au) to be consistent with theoretical predictions of dynamical truncation r<SUB>cav</SUB>/a<SUB>inner</SUB> ≈ 3. The outer orbit of the tertiary star B (0.40 ± 0.28 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, a ∼ 65 ± 18 au, e = 0.3 ± 0.2) is not as well constrained as the inner orbit; however, orbits coplanar with the A system are still preferred (misalignment < 20°). To better understand the influence of the B orbit on the TWA 3A circumbinary disk, we performed SPH simulations of the system and found that the outer edge of the gas disk (r<SUB>outer</SUB> = 8.5 ± 0.2 au) is most consistent with truncation from a coplanar, circular, or moderately eccentric orbit, supporting the preference from the joint orbital fit.",

        "abstract": "In this era of Gaia and ALMA, dynamical stellar mass measurements, derived from spatially and spectrally resolved observations of the Keplerian rotation of circumstellar disks, provide benchmarks that are independent of observations of stellar characteristics and their uncertainties. These benchmarks can then be used to validate and improve stellar evolutionary models, the latter of which can lead to both imprecise and inaccurate mass predictions for pre-main-sequence, low-mass (≤0.5 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) stars. We present the dynamical stellar masses derived from disks around three M stars (FP Tau, J0432+1827, and J1100-7619) using ALMA observations of <SUP>12</SUP>CO (J = 2-1) and <SUP>13</SUP>CO (J = 2-1) emission. These are the first dynamical stellar mass measurements for J0432+1827 and J1100-7619 (0.192 ± 0.005 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and 0.461 ± 0.057 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, respectively) and the most precise measurement for FP Tau (0.395 ± 0.012 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>). Fiducial stellar evolutionary model tracks, which do not include any treatment of magnetic activity, agree with the dynamical stellar mass measurement of J0432+1827 but underpredict the mass by ∼60% for FP Tau and by ∼80% for J1100-7619. Possible explanations for the underpredictions include inaccurate assumptions of stellar effective temperature, undetected binarity for J1100-7619, and that fiducial stellar evolutionary models are not complex enough to represent these stars. In the former case, the stellar effective temperatures would need to be increased by amounts ranging from ∼40 to ∼340 K to reconcile the fiducial stellar evolutionary model predictions with the dynamically measured masses. In the latter case, we show that the dynamical masses can be reproduced using results from stellar evolutionary models with starspots, which incorporate fractional starspot coverage to represent the manifestation of magnetic activity. Folding in low-mass M stars from the literature and assuming that the stellar effective temperatures are imprecise but accurate, we find tentative evidence of a relationship between fractional starspot coverage and observed effective temperature for these young, cool stars.",

        "abstract": "We present new near-infrared Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) spectroscopy of HD 206893 B, a substellar companion orbiting within the debris disk of its F5V star. The J, H, K1, and K2 spectra from GPI demonstrate the extraordinarily red colors of the object, confirming it as the reddest substellar object observed to date. The significant flux increase throughout the infrared presents a challenging atmosphere to model with existing grids. Best-fit values vary from 1200 to 1800 K for effective temperature and from 3.0 to 5.0 for log(g), depending on which individual wavelength band is fit and which model suite is applied. The extreme redness of the companion can be partially reconciled by invoking a high-altitude layer of submicron dust particles, similar to dereddening approaches applied to the peculiar red field L dwarf population. However, reconciling the HD 206893 B spectra with even those of the reddest low-gravity L dwarf spectra still requires the contribution of additional atmospheric dust, potentially due to the debris disk environment in which the companion resides. Orbit fitting from 4 yr of astrometric monitoring is consistent with a ∼30 yr period, an orbital inclination of 147°, and a semimajor axis of 10 au, well within the estimated disk inner radius of ∼50 au. As one of a very few substellar companions imaged interior to a circumstellar disk, the properties of this system offer important dynamical constraints on companion-disk interaction and provide a benchmark for substellar and planetary atmospheric study.",

        "abstract": "Age is a fundamental parameter of stars, yet in many cases, ages of individual stars are presented without robust estimates of the uncertainty. We have developed a Bayesian framework, BAFFLES, to produce the age posterior for a star from its calcium emission strength (log( ${R}_{{HK}}^{{\\prime} }$ )) or lithium abundance (Li EW) and B - V color. We empirically determine the likelihood functions for calcium and lithium as functions of age from literature measurements of stars in benchmark clusters with well-determined ages. We use a uniform prior on age, which reflects a uniform star formation rate. The age posteriors we derive for several test cases are consistent with literature ages found from other methods. BAFFLES represents a robust method to determine the age posterior probability distribution for any field star with 0.45 ≤ B - V ≤ 0.9 and a measurement of ${R}_{{HK}}^{{\\prime} }$ and/or 0.35 ≤ B - V ≤ 1.9 and measured Li EW. We compile colors, ${R}_{{HK}}^{{\\prime} }$ , and Li EW from over 2630 nearby field stars from the literature, and present the derived BAFFLES age posterior for each star.",

        "abstract": "We report the results of a ∼4 yr direct imaging survey of 104 stars to resolve and characterize circumstellar debris disks in scattered light as part of the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) Exoplanet Survey. We targeted nearby (≲150 pc), young (≲500 Myr) stars with high infrared (IR) excesses (L<SUB>IR</SUB>/L<SUB>⋆</SUB> > 10<SUP>-5</SUP>), including 38 with previously resolved disks. Observations were made using the GPI high-contrast integral field spectrograph in H-band (1.6 μm) coronagraphic polarimetry mode to measure both polarized and total intensities. We resolved 26 debris disks and 3 protoplanetary/transitional disks. Seven debris disks were resolved in scattered light for the first time, including newly presented HD 117214 and HD 156623, and we quantified basic morphologies of five of them using radiative transfer models. All of our detected debris disks except HD 156623 have dust-poor inner holes, and their scattered-light radii are generally larger than corresponding radii measured from resolved thermal emission and those inferred from spectral energy distributions. To assess sensitivity, we report contrasts and consider causes of nondetections. Detections were strongly correlated with high IR excess and high inclination, although polarimetry outperformed total intensity angular differential imaging for detecting low-inclination disks (≲70°). Based on postsurvey statistics, we improved upon our presurvey target prioritization metric predicting polarimetric disk detectability. We also examined scattered-light disks in the contexts of gas, far-IR, and millimeter detections. Comparing H-band and ALMA fluxes for two disks revealed tentative evidence for differing grain properties. Finally, we found no preference for debris disks to be detected in scattered light if wide-separation substellar companions were present.",

The disk is detected in total and polarized intensity down to a projected angular separation of 0\"15, or 20 au. On the other hand, the large-scale swept-back halo remains undetected, likely a consequence of its markedly blue color relative to the parent body belt. We analyze the curvature of the disk spine and estimate a radius of ≈100 au for the parent body belt, smaller than past scattered light studies but consistent with thermal emission maps of the system. We employ three different flux-preserving post-processing methods to suppress the residual starlight and evaluate the surface brightness and polarization profile along the disk spine. Unlike past studies of the system, our high-fidelity images reveal the disk to be highly symmetric and devoid of morphological and surface brightness perturbations. We find the dust scattering properties of the system to be consistent with those observed in other debris disks, with the exception of HR 4796. Finally, we find no direct evidence for the presence of a planetary-mass object in the system.",

        "abstract": "The volatile contents of protoplanetary disks both set the potential for planetary chemistry and provide valuable probes of defining disk system characteristics such as stellar mass, gas mass, ionization, and temperature structure. Current disk molecular inventories are fragmented, however, giving an incomplete picture: unbiased spectral line surveys are needed to assess the volatile content. We present here an overview of such a survey of the protoplanetary disks around the Herbig Ae star MWC 480 and the T Tauri star LkCa 15 in ALMA Band 7, spanning ∼36 GHz from 275 to 317 GHz and representing an order of magnitude increase in sensitivity over previous single-dish surveys. We detect 14 molecular species (including isotopologues), with five species (C<SUP>34</SUP>S, <SUP>13</SUP>CS, H<SUB>2</SUB>CS, DNC, and C<SUB>2</SUB>D) detected for the first time in protoplanetary disks. Significant differences are observed in the molecular inventories of MWC 480 and LkCa 15, and we discuss how these results may be interpreted in light of the different physical conditions of these two disk systems.",

        "abstract": "High-contrast medium resolution spectroscopy has been used to detect molecules such as water and carbon monoxide in the atmospheres of gas giant exoplanets. In this work, we show how it can be used to derive radial velocity (RV) measurements of directly imaged exoplanets. Improving upon the traditional cross-correlation technique, we develop a new likelihood based on joint forward modeling of the planetary signal and the starlight background (i.e., speckles). After marginalizing over the starlight model, we infer the barycentric RV of HR 8799 b and c in 2010 yielding -9.2 ± 0.5 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and -11.6 ± 0.5 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, respectively. These RV measurements help to constrain the 3D orientation of the orbit of the planet by resolving the degeneracy in the longitude of an ascending node. Assuming coplanar orbits for HR 8799 b and c, but not including d and e, we estimate {{Ω }}={89^\\circ }<SUB> -17</SUB><SUP> +27</SUP> and i={20\\buildrel{\\circ}\\over{.} 8}<SUB> -3.7</SUB><SUP> +4.5</SUP>.",

        "abstract": "All four circumbinary (CB) protoplanetary disks orbiting short-period (P < 20 days) double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2s)—a group that includes UZ Tau E, for which we present new Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array data—exhibit sky-plane inclinations i <SUB>disk</SUB> that match, to within a few degrees, the sky-plane inclinations i <SUB>⋆</SUB> of their stellar hosts. Although for these systems the true mutual inclinations θ between disk and binary cannot be directly measured because relative nodal angles are unknown, the near coincidence of i <SUB>disk</SUB> and i <SUB>⋆</SUB> suggests that θ is small for these most compact of systems. We confirm this hypothesis using a hierarchical Bayesian analysis, showing that 68% of CB disks around short-period SB2s have θ < 3.°0. Near coplanarity of CB disks implies near coplanarity of CB planets discovered by Kepler, which in turn implies that the occurrence rate of close-in CB planets is similar to that around single stars. By contrast, at longer periods ranging from 30 to 10<SUP>5</SUP> days (where the nodal degeneracy can be broken via, e.g., binary astrometry), CB disks exhibit a wide range of mutual inclinations, from coplanar to polar. Many of these long-period binaries are eccentric, as their component stars are too far separated to be tidally circularized. We discuss how theories of binary formation and disk-binary gravitational interactions can accommodate all these observations.",

        "abstract": "We present a statistical analysis of the first 300 stars observed by the Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey. This subsample includes six detected planets and three brown dwarfs; from these detections and our contrast curves we infer the underlying distributions of substellar companions with respect to their mass, semimajor axis, and host stellar mass. We uncover a strong correlation between planet occurrence rate and host star mass, with stars M <SUB>*</SUB> > 1.5 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> more likely to host planets with masses between 2 and 13M <SUB>Jup</SUB> and semimajor axes of 3-100 au at 99.92% confidence. We fit a double power-law model in planet mass (m) and semimajor axis (a) for planet populations around high-mass stars (M <SUB>*</SUB> > 1.5 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>) of the form {d}<SUP>2</SUP>N/({dm} {da})\\propto {m}<SUP>α </SUP> {a}<SUP>β </SUP>, finding α = -2.4 ± 0.8 and β = -2.0 ± 0.5, and an integrated occurrence rate of {9}<SUB>-4</SUB><SUP>+5</SUP>% between 5-13M <SUB>Jup</SUB> and 10-100 au. A significantly lower occurrence rate is obtained for brown dwarfs around all stars, with {0.8}<SUB>-0.5</SUB><SUP>+0.8</SUP>% of stars hosting a brown dwarf companion between 13-80M <SUB>Jup</SUB> and 10-100 au. Brown dwarfs also appear to be distributed differently in mass and semimajor axis compared to giant planets; whereas giant planets follow a bottom-heavy mass distribution and favor smaller semimajor axes, brown dwarfs exhibit just the opposite behaviors. Comparing to studies of short-period giant planets from the radial velocity method, our results are consistent with a peak in occurrence of giant planets between ∼1 and 10 au. We discuss how these trends, including the preference of giant planets for high-mass host stars, point to formation of giant planets by core/pebble accretion, and formation of brown dwarfs by gravitational instability.",

        "abstract": "Rigorously quantifying the information in high-contrast imaging data is important for informing follow-up strategies to confirm the substellar nature of a point source, constraining theoretical models of planet-disk interactions, and deriving planet occurrence rates. However, within the exoplanet direct imaging community, non-detections have almost exclusively been defined using a frequentist detection threshold (i.e., contrast curve) and associated completeness. This can lead to conceptual inconsistencies when included in a Bayesian framework. A Bayesian upper limit is such that the true value of a parameter lies below this limit with a certain probability. The associated probability is the integral of the posterior distribution with the upper limit as the upper bound. In summary, a frequentist upper limit is a statement about the detectability of planets while a Bayesian upper limit is a statement about the probability of a parameter to lie in an interval given the data. The latter is therefore better suited for rejecting hypotheses or theoretical models based on their predictions. In this work we emphasize that Bayesian statistics and upper limits are more easily interpreted and typically more constraining than the frequentist approach. We illustrate the use of Bayesian analysis in two different cases: (1) with a known planet location where we also propose to use model comparison to constrain the astrophysical nature of the point source and (2) gap-carving planets in TW Hya. To finish, we also mention the problem of combining radial velocity and direct imaging observations.",

        "abstract": "Modern radio interferometers enable observations of spectral lines with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. In spite of these technical advances, many lines of interest are still at best weakly detected and therefore necessitate detection and analysis techniques specialized for the low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) regime. Matched filters can leverage knowledge of the source structure and kinematics to increase sensitivity of spectral line observations. Application of the filter in the native Fourier domain improves S/N while simultaneously avoiding the computational cost and ambiguities associated with imaging, making matched filtering a fast and robust method for weak spectral line detection. We demonstrate how an approximate matched filter can be constructed from a previously observed line or from a model of the source, and we show how this filter can be used to robustly infer a detection significance for weak spectral lines. When applied to ALMA Cycle 2 observations of CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH in the protoplanetary disk around TW Hya, the technique yields a ≈53% S/N boost over aperture-based spectral extraction methods, and we show that an even higher boost will be achieved for observations at higher spatial resolution.

Our sample contains all objects from the PS1 MDS sample with spectroscopic classification that are similar to either of the prototypes SN 2005ap or SN 2007bi, without an explicit limit on luminosity. With a redshift range 0.3< z< 1.6, PS1 MDS is the first SLSN sample primarily probing the high-redshift population; our multifilter PS1 light curves probe the rest-frame UV emission, and hence the peak of the spectral energy distribution. We measure the temperature evolution and construct bolometric light curves, and find peak luminosities of (0.5{--}5)× {10}<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> and lower limits on the total radiated energies of (0.3{--}2)× {10}<SUP>51</SUP> erg. The light curve shapes are diverse, with both rise and decline times spanning a factor of ∼5 and several examples of double-peaked light curves. When correcting for the flux-limited nature of our survey, we find a median peak luminosity at 4000 Å of {M}<SUB>4000</SUB>=-21.1 {mag} and a spread of σ =0.7 {mag}.",

A forward modeling of the <SUP>13</SUP>CO and C<SUP>18</SUP>O J = 2-1 transitions permits a measurement of the total stellar mass in this system, 5.29+/- 0.09 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>, and the circumtriple disk inclination, 137\\buildrel{\\circ}\\over{.} 6+/- 2\\buildrel{\\circ}\\over{.} 0. Optical spectra spanning a 35 yr period were used to derive new radial velocities and, coupled with a spectroscopic disentangling technique, revealed that the A and B components of GW Ori form a double-lined spectroscopic binary with a period of 241.50 ± 0.05 days; a tertiary companion orbits that inner pair with a period of 4218 ± 50 days. Combining the results from the ALMA data and the optical spectra with three epochs of astrometry in the literature, we constrain the individual stellar masses in the system ({M}<SUB>{{A</SUB>}}≈ 2.7 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>, {M}<SUB>{{B</SUB>}}≈ 1.7 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>, {M}<SUB>{{C</SUB>}}≈ 0.9 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>) and find strong evidence that at least one of the stellar orbital planes (and likely both) is misaligned with the disk plane by as much as 45°. A V-band light curve spanning 30 yr reveals several new ∼30-day eclipse events 0.1-0.7 mag in depth and a 0.2 mag sinusoidal oscillation that is clearly phased with the AB-C orbital period. Taken together, these features suggest that the A-B pair may be partially obscured by material in the inner disk as the pair approaches apoastron in the hierarchical orbit. Lastly, we conclude that stellar evolutionary models are consistent with our measurements of the masses and basic photospheric properties if the GW Ori system is ∼1 Myr old.",

We detect emission from dust continuum at 0.89 mm and from the J=3-2 rotational transition of CO from a very compact disk around the young brown dwarf. The small radius found for this brown dwarf disk may be due to truncation from the tidal interaction with the planetary-mass companion. Under the assumption of optically thin dust emission, we estimate a dust mass of 0.1 M <SUB>⊕</SUB> for the 2M1207A disk and a 3σ upper limit of ∼1 M <SUB>Moon</SUB> for dust surrounding 2M1207b, which is the tightest upper limit obtained so far for the mass of dust particles surrounding a young planetary-mass companion. We discuss the impact of this and other non-detections of young planetary-mass companions for models of planet formation that predict circumplanetary material to surround these objects.",

In this study, we present new K1 (1.90-2.19 μm) and K2 (2.10-2.40 μm) spectra taken with the Gemini Planet Imager as well as an updated L <SUB> P </SUB> (3.76 μm) and new M <SUB> S </SUB> (4.67 μm) photometry from the NIRC2 Narrow camera. The new data were combined with J (1.13-1.35 μm) and H (1.50-1.80 μm) spectra from the discovery epoch with the goal of better characterizing the planet properties. The 51 Eri b photometry is redder than field brown dwarfs as well as known young T-dwarfs with similar spectral type (between T4 and T8), and we propose that 51 Eri b might be in the process of undergoing the transition from L-type to T-type. We used two complementary atmosphere model grids including either deep iron/silicate clouds or sulfide/salt clouds in the photosphere, spanning a range of cloud properties, including fully cloudy, cloud-free, and patchy/intermediate-opacity clouds. The model fits suggest that 51 Eri b has an effective temperature ranging between 605 and 737 K, a solar metallicity, and a surface gravity of log(g) = 3.5-4.0 dex, and the atmosphere requires a patchy cloud atmosphere to model the spectral energy distribution (SED). From the model atmospheres, we infer a luminosity for the planet of -5.83 to -5.93 ({log}L/{L}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>), leaving 51 Eri b in the unique position of being one of the only directly imaged planets consistent with having formed via a cold-start scenario. Comparisons of the planet SED against warm-start models indicate that the planet luminosity is best reproduced by a planet formed via core accretion with a core mass between 15 and 127 {M}<SUB>\\oplus </SUB>.",

        "abstract": "We present a new matched-filter algorithm for direct detection of point sources in the immediate vicinity of bright stars. The stellar point-spread function (PSF) is first subtracted using a Karhunen-Loéve image processing (KLIP) algorithm with angular and spectral differential imaging (ADI and SDI). The KLIP-induced distortion of the astrophysical signal is included in the matched-filter template by computing a forward model of the PSF at every position in the image. To optimize the performance of the algorithm, we conduct extensive planet injection and recovery tests and tune the exoplanet spectra template and KLIP reduction aggressiveness to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the recovered planets. We show that only two spectral templates are necessary to recover any young Jovian exoplanets with minimal S/N loss. We also developed a complete pipeline for the automated detection of point-source candidates, the calculation of receiver operating characteristics (ROC), contrast curves based on false positives, and completeness contours. We process in a uniform manner more than 330 data sets from the Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey and assess GPI typical sensitivity as a function of the star and the hypothetical companion spectral type. This work allows for the first time a comparison of different detection algorithms at a survey scale accounting for both planet completeness and false-positive rate. We show that the new forward model matched filter allows the detection of 50% fainter objects than a conventional cross-correlation technique with a Gaussian PSF template for the same false-positive rate.",

        "abstract": "Measurements of radial velocity variations from the spectroscopic monitoring of stars and their companions are essential for a broad swath of astrophysics; these measurements provide access to the fundamental physical properties that dictate all phases of stellar evolution and facilitate the quantitative study of planetary systems. The conversion of those measurements into both constraints on the orbital architecture and individual component spectra can be a serious challenge, however, especially for extreme flux ratio systems and observations with relatively low sensitivity. Gaussian processes define sampling distributions of flexible, continuous functions that are well-motivated for modeling stellar spectra, enabling proficient searches for companion lines in time-series spectra. We introduce a new technique for spectral disentangling, where the posterior distributions of the orbital parameters and intrinsic, rest-frame stellar spectra are explored simultaneously without needing to invoke cross-correlation templates. To demonstrate its potential, this technique is deployed on red-optical time-series spectra of the mid-M-dwarf binary LP661-13. We report orbital parameters with improved precision compared to traditional radial velocity analysis and successfully reconstruct the primary and secondary spectra. We discuss potential applications for other stellar and exoplanet radial velocity techniques and extensions to time-variable spectra. The code used in this analysis is freely available as an open-source Python package.",

        "abstract": "Ages and masses of young stars are often estimated by comparing their luminosities and effective temperatures to pre-main-sequence stellar evolution tracks, but magnetic fields and starspots complicate both the observations and evolution. To understand their influence, we study the heavily spotted weak-lined T-Tauri star LkCa 4 by searching for spectral signatures of radiation originating from the starspot or starspot groups. We introduce a new methodology for constraining both the starspot filling factor and the spot temperature by fitting two-temperature stellar atmosphere models constructed from Phoenix synthetic spectra to a high-resolution near-IR IGRINS spectrum. Clearly discernable spectral features arise from both a hot photospheric component {T}<SUB>{hot</SUB>} ∼ 4100 K and a cool component {T}<SUB>{cool</SUB>} ∼ 2700-3000 K, which covers ∼80% of the visible surface. This mix of hot and cool emission is supported by analyses of the spectral energy distribution, rotational modulation of colors and of TiO band strengths, and features in low-resolution optical/near-IR spectroscopy. Although the revised effective temperature and luminosity make LkCa 4 appear to be much younger and of much lower mass than previous estimates from unspotted stellar evolution models, appropriate estimates will require the production and adoption of spotted evolutionary models. Biases from starspots likely afflict most fully convective young stars and contribute to uncertainties in ages and age spreads of open clusters. In some spectral regions, starspots act as a featureless “veiling” continuum owing to high rotational broadening and heavy line blanketing in cool star spectra. Some evidence is also found for an anticorrelation between the velocities of the warm and cool components.",

        "abstract": "We present Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of the GQ Lup system, a young Sun-like star with a substellar-mass companion in a wide-separation orbit. These observations of 870 μm continuum and CO J = 3-2 line emission with beam size ∼0.″3 (∼45 au) resolve the disk of dust and gas surrounding the primary star, GQ Lup A, and provide deep limits on any circumplanetary disk surrounding the companion, GQ Lup b. The circumprimary dust disk is compact with an FWHM of 59 ± 12 au, while the gas has a larger extent with a characteristic radius of 46.5 ± 1.8 au. By forward-modeling the velocity field of the circumprimary disk based on the CO emission, we constrain the mass of GQ Lup A to be M<SUB>*</SUB> = (1.03 ± 0.05) ∗ (d/156 pc) M<SUB>⊙</SUB>, where d is a known distance, and determine that we view the disk at an inclination angle of 60.°5 ± 0.°5 and a position angle of 346° ± 1°. The 3σ upper limit on the 870 μm flux density of any circumplanetary disk associated with GQ Lup b of <0.15 mJy implies an upper limit on the dust disk mass of <0.04 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> for standard assumptions about optically thin emission. We discuss proposed mechanisms for the formation of wide-separation substellar companions given the non-detection of circumplanetary disks around GQ Lup b and other similar systems.",

        "abstract": "The spatial distribution of gas and solids in protoplanetary disks determines the composition and formation efficiency of planetary systems. A number of disks show starkly different distributions for the gas and small grains compared to millimeter-centimeter-sized dust. We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array observations of the dust continuum, CO, <SUP>13</SUP>CO, and C<SUP>18</SUP>O in the IM Lup protoplanetary disk, one of the first systems where this dust-gas dichotomy was clearly seen. The <SUP>12</SUP>CO is detected out to a radius of 970 au, while the millimeter continuum emission is truncated at just 313 au. Based upon these data, we have built a comprehensive physical and chemical model for the disk structure, which takes into account the complex, coupled nature of the gas and dust and the interplay between the local and external environment. We constrain the distributions of gas and dust, the gas temperatures, the CO abundances, the CO optical depths, and the incident external radiation field. We find that the reduction/removal of dust from the outer disk exposes this region to higher stellar and external radiation and decreases the rate of freeze-out, allowing CO to remain in the gas out to large radial distances. We estimate a gas-phase CO abundance of 5% of the interstellar medium value and a low external radiation field (G <SUB>0</SUB> ≲ 4). The latter is consistent with that expected from the local stellar population. We additionally find tentative evidence for ring-like continuum substructure, suggestions of isotope-selective photodissociation, and a diffuse gas halo.",

Based on the light-curve and multi-epoch spectral energy distributions of SN 2010da, we conclude that the progenitor of SN 2010da is a ≈10-12 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yellow supergiant possibly transitioning into a blue-loop phase. During outburst, SN 2010da had a peak absolute magnitude of M <SUB>bol</SUB> ≲ -10.4 mag, dimmer than other ILOTs and supernova impostors. We detect multi-component hydrogen Balmer, Paschen, and Ca II emission lines in our high-resolution spectra, which indicate a dusty and complex circumstellar environment. Since the 2010 eruption, the star has brightened by a factor of ≈5 and remains highly variable in the optical. Furthermore, we detect SN 2010da in archival Swift and Chandra observations as an ultraluminous X-ray source (L <SUB>X</SUB> ≈ 6 × 10<SUP>39</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>). We additionally attribute He II 4686 Å and coronal Fe emission lines in addition to a steady X-ray luminosity of ≈10<SUP>37</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> to the presence of a compact companion.",

        "abstract": "We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of CO J = 2-1 line emission from the DQ Tau circumbinary disk. These data are used to tomographically reconstruct the Keplerian disk velocity field in a forward-modeling inference framework, and thereby provide a dynamical constraint on the mass of the DQ Tau binary of {M}<SUB>*</SUB>={1.27}<SUB>-0.27</SUB><SUP>+0.46</SUP> {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>. Those results are compared with an updated and improved orbital solution for this double-lined system based on long-term monitoring of its stellar radial velocities. Both of these independent dynamical constraints on the binary mass are in excellent agreement: taken together, they demonstrate that the DQ Tau system mass is 1.21 ± 0.26 M<SUB>⊙</SUB> and that the disk and binary orbital planes are aligned within 3° (at 3σ confidence). The predictions of various theoretical models for pre-main-sequence stellar evolution are also consistent with these masses, though more detailed comparisons are difficult due to lingering uncertainties regarding the photospheric properties of the individual components. DQ Tau is the third, nearly equal-mass, double-lined spectroscopic binary with a circumbinary disk that has been dynamically “weighed” with these two independent techniques: all show consistent results, validating the overall accuracy of the disk-based approach and demonstrating that it can be robustly applied to large samples of young, single stars as ALMA ramps up to operations at full capacity.",

        "abstract": "We present a modular, extensible likelihood framework for spectroscopic inference based on synthetic model spectra. The subtraction of an imperfect model from a continuously sampled spectrum introduces covariance between adjacent datapoints (pixels) into the residual spectrum. For the high signal-to-noise data with large spectral range that is commonly employed in stellar astrophysics, that covariant structure can lead to dramatically underestimated parameter uncertainties (and, in some cases, biases). We construct a likelihood function that accounts for the structure of the covariance matrix, utilizing the machinery of Gaussian process kernels. This framework specifically addresses the common problem of mismatches in model spectral line strengths (with respect to data) due to intrinsic model imperfections (e.g., in the atomic/molecular databases or opacity prescriptions) by developing a novel local covariance kernel formalism that identifies and self-consistently downweights pathological spectral line “outliers.” By fitting many spectra in a hierarchical manner, these local kernels provide a mechanism to learn about and build data-driven corrections to synthetic spectral libraries. An open-source software implementation of this approach is available at <A href=\"http://iancze.github.io/Starfish\">http://iancze.github.io/Starfish</A>, including a sophisticated probabilistic scheme for spectral interpolation when using model libraries that are sparsely sampled in the stellar parameters. We demonstrate some salient features of the framework by fitting the high-resolution V-band spectrum of WASP-14, an F5 dwarf with a transiting exoplanet, and the moderate-resolution K-band spectrum of Gliese 51, an M5 field dwarf.",

By forward-modeling the disk velocity field traced by CO J = 2-1 line emission, we infer the mass of the central binary, {M}<SUB>*</SUB>=2.49+/- 0.10 {M}<SUB>⊙ </SUB>, a new dynamical measurement that is independent of stellar evolutionary models. Assuming the disk and binary are co-planar within ∼2°, this disk-based binary mass measurement is in excellent agreement with constraints from radial velocity monitoring of the combined stellar spectra. These ALMA results are also compared with the standard approach of estimating masses from the location of the binary in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, using several common pre-MS model grids. These models predict stellar masses that are marginally consistent with our dynamical measurement (at ∼2σ), but are systematically high (by ∼10%). These same models consistently predict an age of 18 ± 1 Myr for AK Sco, in line with its membership in the Upper Centaurus-Lupus association but surprisingly old for it to still host a gas-rich disk. As ALMA accumulates comparable data for large samples of pre-MS stars, the methodology employed here to extract a dynamical mass from the disk rotation curve should prove extraordinarily useful for efforts to characterize the fundamental parameters of early stellar evolution.",

        "abstract": "Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based observations of the Type IIn supernova (SN) 2010jl are analyzed, including photometry and spectroscopy in the ultraviolet, optical, and near-IR bands, 26-1128 days after first detection. At maximum, the bolometric luminosity was ~3 × 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> and even at 850 days exceeds 10<SUP>42</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. A near-IR excess, dominating after 400 days, probably originates in dust in the circumstellar medium (CSM). The total radiated energy is >~ 6.5 × 10<SUP>50</SUP> erg, excluding the dust component. The spectral lines can be separated into one broad component that is due to electron scattering and one narrow with expansion velocity ~100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> from the CSM. The broad component is initially symmetric around zero velocity but becomes blueshifted after ~50 days, while remaining symmetric about a shifted centroid velocity. Dust absorption in the ejecta is unlikely to explain the line shifts, and we attribute the shift instead to acceleration by the SN radiation. From the optical lines and the X-ray and dust properties, there is strong evidence for large-scale asymmetries in the CSM. The ultraviolet lines indicate CNO processing in the progenitor, while the optical shows a number of narrow coronal lines excited by the X-rays. The bolometric light curve is consistent with a radiative shock in an r <SUP>-2</SUP> CSM with a mass-loss rate of \\dot{M}∼ 0.1 M_⊙ yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The total mass lost is >~ 3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>. These properties are consistent with the SN expanding into a CSM characteristic of a luminous blue variable progenitor with a bipolar geometry. The apparent absence of nuclear processing is attributed to a CSM that is still opaque to electron scattering.",

        "abstract": "We probe the systematic uncertainties from the 113 Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) in the Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) sample along with 197 SN Ia from a combination of low-redshift surveys. The companion paper by Rest et al. describes the photometric measurements and cosmological inferences from the PS1 sample. The largest systematic uncertainty stems from the photometric calibration of the PS1 and low-z samples. We increase the sample of observed Calspec standards from 7 to 10 used to define the PS1 calibration system. The PS1 and SDSS-II calibration systems are compared and discrepancies up to ~0.02 mag are recovered. We find uncertainties in the proper way to treat intrinsic colors and reddening produce differences in the recovered value of w up to 3%. We estimate masses of host galaxies of PS1 supernovae and detect an insignificant difference in distance residuals of the full sample of 0.037 ± 0.031 mag for host galaxies with high and low masses. Assuming flatness and including systematic uncertainties in our analysis of only SNe measurements, we find w =-1.120<SUP>+0.360</SUP><SUB>-0.206</SUB>(Stat) <SUP>+0.269</SUP><SUB>-0.291</SUB>(Sys). With additional constraints from Baryon acoustic oscillation, cosmic microwave background (CMB) (Planck) and H <SUB>0</SUB> measurements, we find w=-1.166<SUP>+0.072</SUP><SUB>-0.069</SUB> and Ω _m=0.280<SUP>+0.013</SUP><SUB>-0.012</SUB> (statistical and systematic errors added in quadrature). The significance of the inconsistency with w = -1 depends on whether we use Planck or Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe measurements of the CMB: w<SUB>BAO+H0+SN+{WMAP</SUB>}=-1.124<SUP>+0.083</SUP><SUB>-0.065</SUB>.",

        "abstract": "We present griz <SUB>P1</SUB> light curves of 146 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia 0.03 < z < 0.65) discovered during the first 1.5 yr of the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey. The Pan-STARRS1 natural photometric system is determined by a combination of on-site measurements of the instrument response function and observations of spectrophotometric standard stars. We find that the systematic uncertainties in the photometric system are currently 1.2% without accounting for the uncertainty in the Hubble Space Telescope Calspec definition of the AB system. A Hubble diagram is constructed with a subset of 113 out of 146 SNe Ia that pass our light curve quality cuts. The cosmological fit to 310 SNe Ia (113 PS1 SNe Ia + 222 light curves from 197 low-z SNe Ia), using only supernovae (SNe) and assuming a constant dark energy equation of state and flatness, yields w=-1.120<SUP>+0.360</SUP><SUB>-0.206</SUB>{(Stat)} <SUP>+0.269</SUP><SUB>-0.291</SUB>{(Sys)}. When combined with BAO+CMB(Planck)+H <SUB>0</SUB>, the analysis yields Ω _M=0.280<SUP>+0.013</SUP><SUB>-0.012</SUB> and w=-1.166<SUP>+0.072</SUP><SUB>-0.069</SUB> including all identified systematics. The value of w is inconsistent with the cosmological constant value of -1 at the 2.3σ level. Tension endures after removing either the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) or the H <SUB>0</SUB> constraint, though it is strongest when including the H <SUB>0</SUB> constraint. If we include WMAP9 cosmic microwave background (CMB) constraints instead of those from Planck, we find w=-1.124<SUP>+0.083</SUP><SUB>-0.065</SUB>, which diminishes the discord to <2σ. We cannot conclude whether the tension with flat ΛCDM is a feature of dark energy, new physics, or a combination of chance and systematic errors. The full Pan-STARRS1 SN sample with ~three times as many SNe should provide more conclusive results.",

        "abstract": "We present optical photometric and spectroscopic coverage of the superluminous supernova (SLSN) PS1-11ap, discovered with the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey at z = 0.524. This intrinsically blue transient rose slowly to reach a peak magnitude of M<SUB>u</SUB> = -21.4 mag and bolometric luminosity of 8 × 10<SUP>43</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> before settling on to a relatively shallow gradient of decline. The observed decline is significantly slower than those of the SLSNe-Ic which have been the focus of much recent attention. Spectroscopic similarities with the lower redshift SN2007bi and a decline rate similar to <SUP>56</SUP>Co decay time-scale initially indicated that this transient could be a candidate for a pair instability supernova (PISN) explosion. Overall the transient appears quite similar to SN2007bi and the lower redshift object PTF12dam. The extensive data set, from 30 d before peak to 230 d after, allows a detailed and quantitative comparison with published models of PISN explosions. We find that the PS1-11ap data do not match these model explosion parameters well, supporting the recent claim that these SNe are not pair instability explosions. We show that PS1-11ap has many features in common with the faster declining SLSNe-Ic, and the light-curve evolution can also be quantitatively explained by the magnetar spin-down model. At a redshift of z = 0.524, the observer-frame optical coverage provides comprehensive rest-frame UV data and allows us to compare it with the SLSNe recently found at high redshifts between z = 2 and 4. While these high-z explosions are still plausible PISN candidates, they match the photometric evolution of PS1-11ap and hence could be counterparts to this lower redshift transient.",

        "abstract": "We present the Pan-STARRS1 discovery of the long-lived and blue transient PS1-11af, which was also detected by Galaxy Evolution Explorer with coordinated observations in the near-ultraviolet (NUV) band. PS1-11af is associated with the nucleus of an early type galaxy at redshift z = 0.4046 that exhibits no evidence for star formation or active galactic nucleus activity. Four epochs of spectroscopy reveal a pair of transient broad absorption features in the UV on otherwise featureless spectra. Despite the superficial similarity of these features to P-Cygni absorptions of supernovae (SNe), we conclude that PS1-11af is not consistent with the properties of known types of SNe. Blackbody fits to the spectral energy distribution are inconsistent with the cooling, expanding ejecta of a SN, and the velocities of the absorption features are too high to represent material in homologous expansion near a SN photosphere. However, the constant blue colors and slow evolution of the luminosity are similar to previous optically selected tidal disruption events (TDEs). The shape of the optical light curve is consistent with models for TDEs, but the minimum accreted mass necessary to power the observed luminosity is only ~0.002 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, which points to a partial disruption model. A full disruption model predicts higher bolometric luminosities, which would require most of the radiation to be emitted in a separate component at high energies where we lack observations. In addition, the observed temperature is lower than that predicted by pure accretion disk models for TDEs and requires reprocessing to a constant, lower temperature. Three deep non-detections in the radio with the Very Large Array over the first two years after the event set strict limits on the production of any relativistic outflow comparable to Swift J1644+57, even if off-axis.",

        "abstract": "We present observations and analysis of PS1-10bzj, a superluminous supernova (SLSN) discovered in the Pan-STARRS Medium Deep Survey at a redshift z = 0.650. Spectroscopically, PS1-10bzj is similar to the hydrogen-poor SLSNe 2005ap and SCP 06F6, though with a steeper rise and lower peak luminosity (M <SUB>bol</SUB> ~= -21.4 mag) than previous events. We construct a bolometric light curve, and show that while PS1-10bzj's energetics were less extreme than previous events, its luminosity still cannot be explained by radioactive nickel decay alone. We explore both a magnetar spin-down and circumstellar interaction scenario and find that either can fit the data. PS1-10bzj is located in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South and the host galaxy is imaged in a number of surveys, including with the Hubble Space Telescope. The host is a compact dwarf galaxy (M<SUB>B</SUB> ≈ -18 mag, diameter <~ 800 pc), with a low stellar mass (M <SUB>*</SUB> ≈ 2.4 × 10<SUP>7</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>), young stellar population (τ<SUB>*</SUB> ≈ 5 Myr), and a star formation rate of ~2-3 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. The specific star formation rate is the highest seen in an SLSN host so far (~100 Gyr<SUP>-1</SUP>). We detect the [O III] λ4363 line, and find a low metallicity: 12 + (O/H) = 7.8 ± 0.2 (sime 0.1 Z <SUB>⊙</SUB>). Together, this indicates that at least some of the progenitors of SLSNe come from young, low-metallicity populations.",

        "abstract": "We present observations of the afterglows and host galaxies of three short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs): 100625A, 101219A, and 110112A. We find that GRB 100625A occurred in a z = 0.452 early-type galaxy with a stellar mass of ≈4.6 × 10<SUP>9</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> and a stellar population age of ≈0.7 Gyr, and GRB 101219A originated in a star-forming galaxy at z = 0.718 with a stellar mass of ≈1.4 × 10<SUP>9</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, a star formation rate of ≈16 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, and a stellar population age of ≈50 Myr. We also report the discovery of the optical afterglow of GRB 110112A, which lacks a coincident host galaxy to i >~ 26 mag, and we cannot conclusively identify any field galaxy as a possible host. From afterglow modeling, the bursts have inferred circumburst densities of ≈10<SUP>-4</SUP>-1 cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and isotropic-equivalent gamma-ray and kinetic energies of ≈10<SUP>50</SUP>-10<SUP>51</SUP> erg. These three events highlight the diversity of galactic environments that host short GRBs. To quantify this diversity, we use the sample of 36 Swift short GRBs with robust associations to an environment (~1/2 of 68 short bursts detected by Swift to 2012 May) and classify bursts originating from four types of environments: late-type (≈50%), early-type (≈15%), inconclusive (≈20%), and \"host-less\" (lacking a coincident host galaxy to limits of >~ 26 mag ≈15%). To find likely ranges for the true late- and early-type fractions, we assign each of the host-less bursts to either the late- or early-type category using probabilistic arguments and consider the scenario that all hosts in the inconclusive category are early-type galaxies to set an upper bound on the early-type fraction. We calculate most likely ranges for the late- and early-type fractions of ≈60%-80% and ≈20%-40%, respectively. We find no clear trend between gamma-ray duration and host type. We also find no change to the fractions when excluding events recently claimed as possible contaminants from the long GRB/collapsar population. Our reported demographics are consistent with a short GRB rate driven by both stellar mass and star formation.",

        "abstract": "We present the Pan-STARRS1 discovery of PS1-10afx, a unique hydrogen-deficient superluminous supernova (SLSN) at redshift z = 1.388. The light curve peaked at z <SUB>P1</SUB> = 21.7 mag, making PS1-10afx comparable to the most luminous known SNe, with M<SUB>u</SUB> = -22.3 mag. Our extensive optical and near-infrared observations indicate that the bolometric light curve of PS1-10afx rose on the unusually fast timescale of ~12 days to the extraordinary peak luminosity of 4.1 × 10<SUP>44</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> (M <SUB>bol</SUB> = -22.8 mag) and subsequently faded rapidly. Equally important, the spectral energy distribution is unusually red for an SLSN, with a color temperature of ~6800 K near maximum light, in contrast to previous hydrogen-poor SLSNe, which are bright in the ultraviolet (UV). The spectra more closely resemble those of a normal SN Ic than any known SLSN, with a photospheric velocity of ~11, 000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and evidence for line blanketing in the rest-frame UV. Despite the fast rise, these parameters imply a very large emitting radius (gsim 5 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> cm). We demonstrate that no existing theoretical model can satisfactorily explain this combination of properties: (1) a nickel-powered light curve cannot match the combination of high peak luminosity with the fast timescale; (2) models powered by the spindown energy of a rapidly rotating magnetar predict significantly hotter and faster ejecta; and (3) models invoking shock breakout through a dense circumstellar medium cannot explain the observed spectra or color evolution. The host galaxy is well detected in pre-explosion imaging with a luminosity near L*, a star formation rate of ~15 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, and is fairly massive (~2 × 10<SUP>10</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB>), with a stellar population age of ~10<SUP>8</SUP> yr, also in contrast to the young dwarf hosts of known hydrogen-poor SLSNe. PS1-10afx is distinct from known examples of SLSNe in its spectra, colors, light-curve shape, and host galaxy properties, suggesting that it resulted from a different channel than other hydrogen-poor SLSNe.",

Our multi-band light curve traces the fast decline (t <SUB>2</SUB> = 3.5 ± 0.3 days) from maximum light (M<SUB>V</SUB> = -10.2 ± 0.1 mag), placing SN 2010U in the top 0.5% of the most luminous novae ever observed. We find typical ejecta velocities of ≈1100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and that SN 2010U shares many spectral and photometric characteristics with two other fast and luminous Fe II type novae, including Nova LMC 1991 and M31N-2007-11d. For the extreme luminosity of this nova, the maximum magnitude versus rate of decline relationship indicates a massive white dwarf (WD) progenitor with a low pre-outburst accretion rate. However, this prediction is in conflict with emerging theories of nova populations, which predict that luminous novae from massive WDs should preferentially exhibit an alternate spectral type (He/N) near maximum light.",

        "abstract": "We present the first spectroscopic study of the host environments of Type Ibc supernovae (SNe Ibc) discovered exclusively by untargeted SN searches. Past studies of SN Ibc host environments have been biased toward high-mass, high-metallicity galaxies by focusing on SNe discovered in galaxy-targeted SN searches. Our new observations more than double the total number of spectroscopic stellar population age and metallicity measurements published for untargeted SN Ibc host environments. For the 12 SNe Ib and 21 SNe Ic in our metallicity sample, we find median metallicities of 0.62 Z <SUB>⊙</SUB> and 0.83 Z <SUB>⊙</SUB>, respectively, but determine that the discrepancy in the full distribution of metallicities is not statistically significant. This median difference would correspond to only a small difference in the mass loss via metal-line-driven winds (lsim 30%), suggesting this does not play the dominant role in distinguishing SNe Ib and Ic progenitors. However, the median metallicity of the seven broad-lined SNe Ic (SNe Ic-BL) in our sample is significantly lower, 0.45 Z <SUB>⊙</SUB>. The age of the young stellar population of SN Ic-BL host environments also seems to be lower than for SNe Ib and Ic, but our age sample is small. Combining all SN Ibc host environment spectroscopy from the literature to date does not reveal a significant difference in SN Ib and Ic metallicities, but reinforces the significance of the lower metallicities for SNe Ic-BL. This combined sample demonstrates that galaxy-targeted SN searches introduce a significant bias for studies seeking to infer the metallicity distribution of SN progenitors, and we identify and discuss other systematic effects that play smaller roles. We discuss the path forward for making progress on SN Ibc progenitor studies in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope era. This paper includes data gathered with the 6.5 m Magellan Telescopes located at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile.",

An extensive X-ray light curve from Swift/XRT, XMM-Newton, and Chandra, spanning ~100 s to 10 days after the burst, reveals a significant break at δt ≈ 2 days with pre- and post-break decline rates of α<SUB> X, 1</SUB> ≈ -0.78 and α<SUB> X, 2</SUB> <~ -1.7, respectively. Interpreted as a jet break, we infer a collimated outflow with an opening angle of θ<SUB> j </SUB> ≈ 3°-8°. The resulting beaming-corrected γ-ray (10-1000 keV band) and blast-wave kinetic energies are (2-3) × 10<SUP>48</SUP> erg and (0.3-2) × 10<SUP>49</SUP> erg, respectively, with the range depending on the unknown redshift of the burst. We report a radio afterglow limit of <39 μJy (3σ) from Expanded Very Large Array observations that, along with our finding that ν<SUB> c </SUB> < ν<SUB> X </SUB>, constrains the circumburst density to n <SUB>0</SUB> ~ 0.01-0.1 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. Optical observations provide an afterglow limit of i >~ 24.4 mag at 18 hr after the burst and reveal a potential host galaxy with i ≈ 24.3 mag. The subarcsecond localization from Chandra provides a precise offset of 0farcs80 ± 0farcs11 (1σ) from this galaxy corresponding to an offset of 5-7 kpc for z = 0.5-1.5. We find a high excess neutral hydrogen column density of (7.5 ± 2.0) × 10<SUP>21</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> (z = 0). Our observations demonstrate that a growing fraction of short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are collimated, which may lead to a true event rate of >~ 100-1000 Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, in good agreement with the NS-NS merger rate of ≈200-3000 Gpc<SUP>-3</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. This consistency is promising for coincident short GRB-gravitational wave searches in the forthcoming era of Advanced LIGO/VIRGO.",

        "abstract": "We present the Pan-STARRS1 discovery and light curves, and follow-up MMT and Gemini spectroscopy of an ultraluminous supernova (ULSN; dubbed PS1-11bam) at a redshift of z = 1.566 with a peak brightness of M <SUB>UV</SUB> ≈ -22.3 mag. PS1-11bam is one of the highest redshift spectroscopically confirmed SNe known to date. The spectrum exhibits broad absorption features typical of previous ULSNe (e.g., C II, Si III), and strong and narrow Mg II and Fe II absorption lines from the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy, confirmed by an [O II]λ3727 emission line at the same redshift. The equivalent widths of the Fe II λ2600 and Mg II λ2803 lines are in the top quartile of the quasar intervening absorption system distribution, but are weaker than those of gamma-ray burst intrinsic absorbers (i.e., GRB host galaxies). We also detect the host galaxy in pre-explosion Pan-STARRS1 data and find that its UV spectral energy distribution is best fit with a young stellar population age of τ<SUB>*</SUB> ≈ 15-45 Myr and a stellar mass of M <SUB>*</SUB> ≈ (1.1-2.6) × 10<SUP>9</SUP> M <SUB>⊙</SUB> (for Z = 0.05-1 Z <SUB>⊙</SUB>). The star formation rate inferred from the UV continuum and [O II]λ3727 emission line is ≈10 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, higher than in previous ULSN hosts. PS1-11bam provides the first direct demonstration that ULSNe can serve as probes of the ISM in distant galaxies. The depth and red sensitivity of PS1 are uniquely suited to finding such events at cosmologically interesting redshifts (z ~ 1-2); the future combination of LSST and 30 m class telescopes promises to extend this technique to z ~ 4.",

        "abstract": "We present the discovery of two ultraluminous supernovae (SNe) at z ≈ 0.9 with the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey. These SNe, PS1-10ky and PS1-10awh, are among the most luminous SNe ever discovered, comparable to the unusual transients SN 2005ap and SCP 06F6. Like SN 2005ap and SCP 06F6, they show characteristic high luminosities (M <SUB>bol</SUB> ≈ -22.5 mag), blue spectra with a few broad absorption lines, and no evidence for H or He. We have constructed a full multi-color light curve sensitive to the peak of the spectral energy distribution in the rest-frame ultraviolet, and we have obtained time series spectroscopy for these SNe. Given the similarities between the SNe, we combine their light curves to estimate a total radiated energy over the course of explosion of (0.9-1.4) × 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg. We find photospheric velocities of 12,000-19,000 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> with no evidence for deceleration measured across ~3 rest-frame weeks around light curve peak, consistent with the expansion of an optically thick massive shell of material. We show that, consistent with findings for other ultraluminous SNe in this class, radioactive decay is not sufficient to power PS1-10ky, and we discuss two plausible origins for these events: the initial spin-down of a newborn magnetar in a core-collapse SN, or SN shock breakout from the dense circumstellar wind surrounding a Wolf-Rayet star.",

In both cases, the dust emission is resolved and localized around one stellar component—the HD 98800B and Hen 3-600A spectroscopic binaries—with no evidence for circum-system material. Using two-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer calculations, we compare the Submillimeter Array interferometer visibilities and broadband spectral energy distributions with truncated disk models to empirically locate the inner and outer edges of both disks. The HD 98800B disk appears to be aligned with the spectroscopic binary orbit, is internally truncated at a radius of 3.5 AU, and extends to only 10-15 AU from the central stars. The Hen 3-600A disk is slightly larger, with an inner edge at ~1 AU and an outer radius of 15-25 AU. These inferred disk structures compare favorably with theoretical predictions of their truncation due to tidal interactions with the stellar companions.",
