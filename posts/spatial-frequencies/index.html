You can see that the amplitudes of the high spatial frequency sinusoids are attenuated as the image gradually loses resolution. By the end, the scale of the remaining features in the image are comparable to the periods of the non-zero sinusoids.</p><h2 id=high-pass-filter>High pass filter</h2><video controls preload=auto width=100% playsinline class=html-video>

As the low spatial frequency features are attenuated, you can see the image lose its broader, more spatially uniform regions like the sky, clouds, and sea. The higher spatial frequency features remain, such as the outlines of buildings and vegetation.</p></article></main></div></div></main><script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script><script id=MathJax-script async src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js></script></body></html>
